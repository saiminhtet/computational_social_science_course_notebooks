    "# Web Scraping Part 1: Getting Data from HTML Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "John McLevey  \n",
    "February 1, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will work through an example of scraping the web to collect data for research on funding for non-profit organizations. The example below comes from [an article called \"Think Tanks, Funding, and the Politics of Policy Knowledge in Canada,\" which I published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cars.12033/full). It was based on a chapter from my PhD dissertation (2013). \n",
    "\n",
    "The article analyzed funding data for 30 Canadian think tanks over 11 years to weigh in on some pretty high-level debates in sociology and political science about whether or not the politics of any given think tank are associated with the type of funders they have. My analysis was exporatory and, really, just simple description. I collected funding data for all the known think tanks in the country, and then analyzed that data using a really simple quantitative method called [correspondence analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_analysis), which is similair to the more widely-known method [principle components analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). You can get the gist of what I found just by reading the article abstract: \n",
    "\n",
    "> The relationships between think tanks and their funders are central to theory and public discourse about the politics of policy knowledge, yet very little research systematically examines these relationships across cases. This article evaluates elite, pluralist, and field theories by analyzing original data on funding and politics for 30 think tanks from 2000 to 2011 with comparative and relational methods. I find that foreign donations help support some conservative think tanks, but that it is a small amount of money relative to other funding sources. Domestically, think tank funding is structured by an opposition between donor-funded conservatives and state-funded centrists. Since 2005, the cluster of conservative think tanks funded by private donors has become tighter, while the cluster of think tanks supported by the state has become looser and more reliant on self-generated revenue and interest and investments. These findings cast doubt on predictions derived from elite and pluralist theories, and offer some support for field theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data were scraped from the Charities Listings of the Canada Revenue Agency, which provides Information Returns for all registered charities in the country. Here are a few relevant paragraphs from the article about the data I used: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Canadian think tanks have to file annual T3010 Information Returns with the CRA to maintain their tax-exempt charitable status. The returns are available in a searchable database, making it is possible to look up information for specific organizations at specific times. To evaluate claims about funding and political orientations, I collected financial data from 2000 to 2011, or from founding date to latest filing, for 30 think tanks. To automate the collection process and eliminate human error, I used a Perl script to scrape data from the charities listings for each organization and create a data set of all publicly available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The case-selection process was inclusive. I compiled a list of think tanks mentioned by interviewees, from the literature, news stories and op-eds, and public lists and rankings (e.g., McGann 2010). I excluded university-based institutes, consulting firms, some very small single-issue think tanks, and one nonprofit think tank without charitable status. Finally, I included two organizations whose activities are more extensive than others in the analysis: the David Suzuki Foundation and the Institute of Marriage and Family.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Under “Section E: Financial Information” of the Information Returns, I combined municipal, provincial, and federal funding into “state funding,” and I classified rental income, memberships, dues, fees, and sale of goods and services (except to government) as “self-generated revenue.” I combined entries for tax-receipted and non-tax-receipted gifts, and gifts from other registered charities, as “private donations.”\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are going to start the process of developing a web scraper to collect similair data from the [CRA Charities Listing](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/advancedsearch-eng.action). This is *not* the scraper I used to collect the data used in the journal article. That scraper was written in [Perl](https://www.perl.org) by my friend Andrew Osmond. \n",
    "\n",
    "![XKCD on Perl and regular expressions...](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/perl_problems.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this notebook will use the Montréal-based think tank [IRPP (the Institute for Research on Public Policy / Institut de recherche en politiques publiques)](http://irpp.org) as an example, but you can use any non-profit you like. Just find them in the listing and make the necessary modifications to the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we don't actually need to write a lot of code to get what we want. The heavy lifting is really being done by [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org). We will make some improvements to this scraper in subsequent classes. "
