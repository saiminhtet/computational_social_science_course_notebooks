       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In his first State of the Union address, Donald <b>Trump</b> again reiterated his campaign promise to bring down drug costs. But a year into his presidency, he's done nothing of the sort. And if U.S. negotiators and powerful corporate lobbyists have their way, the new <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> (<span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>) will change in ways that would keep drug prices high and out of reach for people in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and beyond.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Officials from <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> member states just wrapped up their sixth round of talks in Montreal, and on the table were serious implications for access to affordable health care. Time and again, Canadians reaffirm their belief in the basic principle of equitable access to health care for all. But the spirit of this very Canadian principle remains in peril as <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> negotiations forge ahead.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Already, according to a 2015 Angus Reid study, one in five Canadians say a member of their household cannot afford medications prescribed to them. Millions of people—between 10 and 20 per cent of the population—are compensating by not filling their prescriptions at all or taking unsupported measures to make them last longer.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canadians already pay some of the highest drug prices in the world according to the <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Institute for Health Information</span>, and pharmaceutical products are one of the three largest elements of our overall healthcare spending.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There are two potential changes to <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> that threaten to derail progress toward affordable access to medicines:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, U.S. trade representatives are advancing Big Pharma's demand for more restrictive intellectual property rules, pushing longer patent terms and “data exclusivity” rules that would lengthen the period they can keep secret the data they submit to <span class=\"companylink\">Health Canada</span> for new drug approvals.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This would delay the development of generics and boost patented companies' already handsome profits at patients' expense, by extending monopolies on medicines and thwarting market competition to lower consumer prices.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Second, business lobbies are pushing hard to maintain and expand the widely-denounced “investor-state dispute settlement” mechanism currently found in <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Usually, disputes over trade agreements are hashed out between the governments that signed them. But this kind of clause allows companies to take direct legal action against governments for interfering with their profits—or even their expectations of profits—by regulating in the public interest.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When these cases succeed, governments end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars for acting in the public interest, such as protecting access to medicines or the environment. At a minimum, these provisions in trade agreements create a chilling effect against governments doing the right thing from the get-go.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The fine print of what Big Pharma and the U.S. are pushing in <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> is complex. But the end goal is clear: they want to rework the deal to increase corporate power and profits, when drug prices are already unaffordable for many. <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> could also be used as a dangerous template for global trade agreements to come.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This is why Canadian and Mexican negotiators should stand up to the Americans, in the interest of their own people and of the millions around the world who cannot afford yet more deadly trade deals keeping medicines out of reach.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Big Pharma is already well protected by existing <span class=\"companylink\">World Trade Organization</span> standards, based heavily on the original <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. There is no need, nor moral defence, for even greater monopolies on medicines.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It seems we can't count on <b>Trump</b>'s promises to develop sound policy that would cut prescription drug cost. But north of the border there are concrete things Canada must do to safeguard affordable access to medicines, at home and abroad, and save lives.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <b>Trudeau</b> government keeps saying that governments must be allowed to regulate in the public interest. Instead of bowing to Big Pharma, Canadian negotiators now have the opportunity to advance a key Canadian interest.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">You ride the streetcar home one spring morning next year, flipping through missed messages after a frantic work day. A tweet pops up with an embedded video that immediately plays a nasty attack on Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, making claims about corruption. It is sent by someone you have never heard of, on behalf of an obviously fictitious organization. Irritated, you scroll back to replay it, to try to figure who sent it.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It is gone.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is no ad, no record of your having received it. Nothing. You wonder whether you imagined it, then with horror realize you did not and shudder at the appalling implications of such a tool.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This disappearing video technique, according to American technical journalists, was used by the <b>Trump</b> campaign — and probably by its foreign partners — thousands of times an hour in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. It has since been enhanced to permit the use of artificial intelligence tools to capture a real video, alter its identity and edit it almost undetectably to say something different than the original.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A few seats back on the streetcar, another <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span> target discovers something strange about a good friend's account. Not only have her followers grown from 1,700 to 700,000, she is saying things about Jagmeet Singh that are repulsive. She texts her pal, who is appalled at this online impersonation and immediately deletes her account. She is unaware that her digital doppelganger lives on and can be cloned thousands of times with almost imperceptible tweaks to her photo or her bio.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <span class=\"companylink\">New York Times</span> last week reported that the going rate to buy stolen or fabricated IDs and retweets on the dark web is little more than one dollar for 1,000 fake <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span> accounts. A dollar.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If you have thought it improbable that some tech writers have estimated that somewhere between a third and half of <b>Trump</b>'s 47 million claimed followers are fake, do the math. That would have cost helpful supporters not more than $25,000, less than a dinner event at Mar a Lago.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <b>Trump</b> campaign pioneered another astonishing digital campaign tool: instant mass message testing. Each morning up to 10,000 computer-generated versions of the same ad, with small variations in colour, font, images, length, music, and message would be sent to a few thousand recipients. Each message opened or retweeted was tracked by type of voter — age, race, income, education — and by precinct in a congressional district.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In minutes, the campaign trimmed the messages to a few dozen, sending the highest impact to the specific voter demographic and location. One horrific example uncovered by the Times was the use of racist messages targeted at white voters in districts where a white police officer had been killed in recent months. Hourly rotations of messaging were often delivered from an ever-growing catalogue.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Until now neither <span class=\"companylink\">Facebook</span>, nor <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span>, nor any other social media platform, has any reliable means to discover — in advance, as it is being sent, or even after the fact — who is paying for this skulduggery. It took <span class=\"companylink\">Facebook</span> nearly a year to discover and to disclose the Russian use of its platform.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Put these four factors together — disappearing ads, fake senders, massive targeted volumes, anonymous sponsors — and you can see why <span class=\"companylink\">Elections Canada</span> is wrestling so hard with the issue of election security right now. Yes, we have better protection in one domain: it's hard to print, distribute, and stuff fake paper ballots. We have as well a serious identity-checking ability about voters themselves.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We are naked and vulnerable, however, where two earlier stage threats to a level playing field are concerned: pre-election social media advertising by unknown third parties, and massive campaign period overspending, paid for offshore undetectably. This is not a future problem or fantasy. The U.S. campaign was a victim of these techniques, and probably othersyet to be revealed by Robert Mueller.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It is challenging to know how to tackle any of this. The Germans and the Brits are forcing the social media companies to be responsible for content on their networks, the real identity of those sponsoring it, and provably tracing the source of the payments. But these are enforcement techniques mostly useful after the fact. The damage the Russians did in the U.S. was unknown until many months after they had influenced thousands of voters.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the long run, experts say a savvy and skeptical public needs to be educated about the signs of fakery. That would certainly help, but not before a federal election in less than two years' time.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A revolution is coming to Ottawa in two weeks.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For the past two years, the Leap Manifesto has been a disruptive force within New Democratic Party politics. Now, on the eve of the federal NDP convention this month, top organizers for U.S. Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and British Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn are coming to town to lend the Leap movement support.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That leftist movement — led by prominent Canadian activists Naomi Klein and Avi Lewis — will stir things up whether the current NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, likes it or not.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“Courage to Leap” is the title of the Feb. 15 event, and the marquee speakers are disrupters themselves from the nations of Donald <b>Trump</b> and Brexit. Among them: Becky Bond, a senior adviser to Sanders and co-author of Rules for Revolutionaries; Emma Rees and Adam Klug from the Momentum U.K. movement; and Marsha De Cordova, a Labour MP and Corbyn's shadow minister for disabled people.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Bond, who has been carrying a battered old copy of the Leap Manifesto around in her pocket as she organizes across the United States, says there is a natural alliance between Sanders supporters and the people who have lined up behind Leap in Canada and Corbyn in Britain.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“It's not just a movement in the United States,” Bond said in an interview with the Star. “It's a movement that includes people from Canada and the U.K. and other countries. I'm going there (to Ottawa) for connections. I'm there to learn what I need to learn so that next time we don't fall short and that we win.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the U.K. this week, Klug and Rees of Momentum — a “grassroots campaigning network” that arose out of Corbyn's leadership campaign — were getting ready to make their first trip to Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“There's so many similar themes and parallels, both in terms of the kind of society we want to achieve and in what we're trying to build,” Klug said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Corbyn's showing in last year's snap British elections[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/06/09/shock-uk-result-leaves-brexit-in-trouble-tories-a-mess-and-europe-on-shaking-ground-burman.html] — 40 per cent of the popular vote — is proof that a populist-left manifesto can translate into electoral success for parties willing to take the risk, says Rees.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“In the space of just over six weeks Labour made an absolutely historic comeback,” Rees said. “The manifesto was incredibly popular … it really disproved that conventional wisdom, that you can't put forward a bold, transformative manifesto.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The “Courage to Leap” event, to be held at the Museum of Nature, is not formally on the schedule of the NDP convention that gets under way in Ottawa on Feb. 16, but its organizers intend it to be a scene setter, and a provocative one at that. The event's title is an amalgam of its two hosts: the Leap movement, and the “Courage” organization, which calls itself a coalition of the independent left “trying to bridge the divide between movement and electoral politics.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Much has changed since Leap was last shaking things up in the NDP — the party has a new leader, Singh, who took over last fall. As well, <b>Trump</b> has become president of the United States and Britain has voted to get out of the <span class=\"companylink\">European Union</span>. These latter two developments — a surge of populism on the right — are being seen as an even stronger argument for a progressive populism of the left.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Moreover, says Avi Lewis, Canada has now seen two full years of government under Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> — two years that have seen the unravelling of some of his progressive promises, whether on electoral reform or protecting the environment. So for all these reasons, neither he nor Klein are expecting to get the same kind of backlash they received in Edmonton.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“It is a different moment,” says Lewis. “I think the ground has shifted dramatically in the country.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Leap Manifesto is a declaration, fewer than 1,500 words in total, calling for some sweeping policies to deal with global problems such as climate change, and income inequality. Among the recommendations are an end to all pipelines and international trade deals, as well as calls for national child care program and studies into a basic, guaranteed income.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It first landed in the midst of the 2015 election campaign, right around the time that NDP leader Thomas Mulcair's fortunes were beginning to slide in the polls — going from the likely next prime minister in August, to third-place finisher in October that year. Many of the more centrist or pragmatic folks in the NDP accused Leap of undermining the party's chance at power, scaring off Canadians who feared the “radical left.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Leap returned to the NDP convention in Edmonton in April 2016, where Mulcair was toppled[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/04/10/ndp-leader-thomas-mulcair-urges-delegates-to-keep-him-on-voting-day.html] in a leadership review. The movement, and its champions, had a similarly rough ride in Edmonton — Alberta Premier Rachel Notley made it abundantly clear that its ideas weren't welcome.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“Those ideas will never form any part of our policy. They are naive, they are ill-informed and they are tone-deaf,” said Notley, who saw Leap as undoing all the work she had done to make the party acceptable to the all-important resource sector of Alberta.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Still, a majority of NDP members voted in Edmonton to study the policies in the Leap Manifesto, and in an EKOS poll a few months later — one that Lewis is fond of quoting — a full 40 per cent of respondents said they could get behind the ideas in the declaration.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's that “ideas” thing that Bond has been emphasizing when she is out organizing in the United States. The people who united behind Bernie Sanders were there for what he was saying — the radical shakeup he was proposing, Bond said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“It really wasn't about Bernie,” she says. “It really was about a movement of people that are really ready for big change and being able to tap into all of those people and work together to make the change, whether the politicians have it on the agenda or not.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The ideas linking Leap, Momentum and the Sanders campaign are large ones: fighting climate change, the power of banks and corporations and income inequality. They are all focused too on mobilizing volunteers with real tasks and duties — Bond has written extensively about how political organization leans too much on staff and too little on volunteers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She carries the Leap Manifesto around with her as a tool of persuasion — to show Americans that the ideas transcend national boundaries. It was Klein herself who gave the paper to Bond, when they met up not long after the U.S. election. Bond was still coming to grips with a momentous time in U.S. politics. While <b>Trump</b> had won and Democrats had lost, the Sanders campaign had galvanized a lot of people. <b>Trump</b> in the White House is serving as a daily reminder of the need for a progressive populism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“When I was handed the Leap Manifesto I saw that this was also happening in Canada . . . a movement of people organizing themselves, not behind a politician, but behind a set of ideas that we could fight for,” said Bond.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Rees and Klug make the same point about Corbyn; that policies, not personalities, are what build populist movements. Yet personality and celebrity seems to drive so much of politics these days — at least when it comes to traditional media.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Which brings us to <b>Trudeau</b>. These activists from the United States and Britain have been naturally curious about this Liberal leader who campaigned to the left of Mulcair (fiscally at least) and who sold progressive hope and change, with much of the same kind of sweeping rhetoric as the Leap Manifesto.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Watching <b>Trudeau</b> in power, however, the activists are reminded of other politicians in their own countries, who raised the hopes of the progressive left and then let them down.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For Rees and Klug, that's Tony Blair. <b>Trudeau</b> reminds Klug of the former prime minister of Britain, who came to office in the late 1990s with his “Third Way” politics but turned out to be just another pragmatic politician, averse to the big change he once championed.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Klug sees a bit of that in <b>Trudeau</b>, particularly, “the whole approach to politics as more top-down or impressive sound bites and spin … appearing to be a likeable character, but not one who invites mass participation in the political process.” That could be a description of Blair or <b>Trudeau</b>, he says.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">From Bond's vantage point in the United States, the difference between <b>Trudeau</b> the campaigner and <b>Trudeau</b> in office reminds her of none other than Barack Obama. While Canadians on the left may see that as a compliment, it is not exactly meant that way in Sanders's circles. The Sanders campaign, in fact, had been seen as the product of Democratic disenchantment with politics as usual as it was practised by Obama, and before that, Bill (and Hillary) Clinton.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">With what is clearly a trademark bluntness, Bond describes the <b>Trudeau</b>-Obama comparison this way:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“I think that we are much faster to catch on to the fact that <b>Trudeau</b> wasn't the reformer that people had hoped, and that what's happening in Canada right now is going to be a bit of a replay of the disappointment that progressives experienced when we elected and re-elected Barack Obama.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This is the kind of thing that Avi Lewis is talking about when he describes Canada as being in a “different moment” today than it was in April 2016, when Leap landed at the NDP convention. Back then, the <b>Trudeau</b> government was still in its honeymoon after only a few months in power and the progressive left in Canada was still relieved to be getting past the Stephen Harper years.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">These days, Lewis, says, many of those progressives may be ready to take a new look at a party that embraced something bolder — something like Leap. “I believe, many of us believe, that there is a progressive majority in Canada,” says Lewis.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Krug and Rees also reject the criticism of Leap and its allies as leftists from the fringe. That label often comes from people with a stake in fighting big changes to the system, says Rees.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“For the first year and a half, Jeremy Corbyn and Momentum were painted as extreme or at one end of a political spectrum, and then 40 per cent of the British public voted for the political offer that the Labour party put forward in the manifesto,” said Rees, who actually gave up a career as a teacher to become a full-time campaigner for Corbyn (as did Klug). “So I think you could argue that actually those are mainstream ideas, that those are centre-ground, common-sense political ideas. I think, really, with all this rhetoric, I would question who gets to say what's extreme and what's actually middle-of-the-road.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Tickets for the “Courage to Leap” event are expected to sell out quickly, but it's far from clear how Leap itself will fare on the convention floor this time in Ottawa. The party did commit itself to “study” Leap back in 2016, but will that have any impact on the party being built under Singh's new leadership?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But it also seems to be true that Leap's influence doesn't start or stop with the NDP, or even Canada. Regardless of what happens at the Ottawa convention, the activists from the United States and the U.K. seem to think that big things are on the horizon.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Bond, when asked what's next after this meeting, talks about high hopes — with a global reach. “What I hope will come out of this meeting in Ottawa is that everybody comes together,” she says. If you can change who is involved in politics I think we can change how we govern and I think we can change the future of our countries.”</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Last week, in the midst of the #MeToo movement, members of Parliament debated legislation to curb what can only be described as rampant sexual harassment and abuse on Parliament Hill and in federally regulated work forces (think the RCMP).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Bill C-65 will not apply to MPs, but it should. Because if anyone is wondering what is holding more women back from running for office — or staying in it once they get there — they should start by considering the widespread harassment and bullying women politicians face, and how long men in power have been perpetuating it.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That needs to change. As Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> told Liberal MPs last week, “Add women, change politics is how we will make a better country.” Or, indeed, a better world.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But as the debate on Bill C-65 showed, it will be a long time coming if the status quo is not changed.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Conservative MP Michelle Rempel[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/01/30/sexual-harassment-legislation-alone-cannot-change-the-culture-in-ottawa.html] illustrated this point with an example of a woman allegedly abused by former MP Rick Dykstra. The women complained to police in 2014 that Dykstra pressured her to perform oral sex on him after a night of drinking, but senior officials in his party allowed him to run in the 2015 election. They “should be ashamed of themselves,” said. Rempel. (Party leader Andrew Scheer has now ordered an investigation into how that was allowed to happen.)</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Rempel was talking about a Conservative staff member who may have been intimidated by the power an MP wields. But she could just as easily have been talking about how the powers-that-be in politics have treated their female counterparts, many of whom have come forward to discuss the sexist and abusive behaviour they have had to endure.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Rempel herself has written[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/04/19/trudeau-taking-tory-mp-complaints-about-sexism-in-parliament-seriously.html] that she is regularly called a “bitch” if she doesn't comply with someone's request. The degradation also “involves my ass being occasionally grabbed as a way to shock me into submission.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Sadly, her experience is far from unique. Nor is it new. Former MP Sheila Copps revealed in 2014 that she was sexually assaulted by a legislator more than 30 years ago — unbelievably, while on a tour studying violence against women.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But while sexual abuse is the topic du jour, it isn't the only thing holding women back from fully participating in politics in 2018.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, political parties (some more so than others) do not do enough work to find potential female candidates. (Hello, federal Conservatives!) Just as bad, when women are asked to run it is often in ridings where there's little hope their party will win. In other words, they are set up for failure.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It doesn't have to be that way. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland is a perfect example. She was personally recruited from a stellar career in journalism by <b>Trudeau</b>, and is now one of the top lieutenants in his gender-parity cabinet.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In short, it's not that there are not enough qualified women; it's that there are not enough qualified party members seeking them out.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Still, in a perfect world, they wouldn't wait to be asked. They'd run on their own. That's where Equal Voice, a non-partisan organization dedicated to getting women elected at all levels of office, comes in. They do so by encouraging women to run for office through an online campaign school, as well as raising awareness about the impact of women's under-representation in politics.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Another badly needed change is making political life more family-friendly. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna made headlines in 2016 when she announced she intended to leave the office every day at 5:30 to do homework with her children and sit down to dinner as a family before returning to work at 8 p.m. “I'm not going to be a good minister unless I'm happy at home,” she told the Star.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In an article she co-wrote in the Ottawa Citizen in 2014, McKenna suggested introducing such steps as video-conferencing and condensed parliamentary sessions so that commuting MPs could spend more time at home. She also recommended an end to evening parliamentary sessions so parents could get home for bedtime. There's no reason those changes can't be made.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">More than 22 years ago, the federal government made a commitment that every piece of legislation, and all new policies and programs, would be subjected to what is called a “gender-based analysis.” The goal was to bring women's experience to decision-making. It hasn't worked.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Change needs to come from within. But only 26 per cent of Canadian MPs are female, below the 30-per-cent threshold the United Nations says leads to a shift in policy and practice in government. Nor is it the 50 per cent we should aspire to. Indeed, it will take another 90 years at the current glacial pace of change to reach that level, according to an analysis by Equal Voice.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada should hang its head. This country ranks a shameful 64th among almost 200 countries in its percentage of women MPs, according to the <span class=\"companylink\">Inter-Parliamentary Union</span>. Sweden, Finland and Norway lead the pack of Western countries on that list (women hold more than 40 per cent of the seats in their parliaments).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ironically, what may encourage more women to run for office may actually be the sexism and misogyny that still rules the day. Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY's List, the largest resource for women in politics in the United States, believes that Donald <b>Trump</b> may be responsible for the fact that since his election more than 26,000 women have signed up for more information on running for office.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Equal Voice says it, too, has seen a recent uptick in interest in its campaign boot camps.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Maybe the next phase of the #MeToo movement will be a wave of women running for office and finally tipping the general balance in political life. We can only hope so.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The undefended border between the U.S. and Canada is porous. People pass freely, but so do infectious agents and syndromes. I've seen many in my time, mostly during Republican administrations. Few match the power or breadth of the Canadianized strain of <b>Trump</b> derangement syndrome. Whatever Mr. <b>Trump</b> does, Canadians are against it.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Take the <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>. Back in the early 1990s, Canadian unions, academics and \"celebrities,\" as well as Canada's Liberal and New Democratic Parties, passionately argued against Nafta. It would destroy us, they said. We would lose our sovereignty. We would lose our social programs. We would become the 51st state!</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Now President <b>Trump</b> has called Nafta into question, and many former detractors are suddenly defending the deal. The dubious have become believers. True, some of this is because time has shown Nafta to be good for Canada, but most of it is reflexive. Canadian liberals are defending Nafta because Mr. <b>Trump</b> is against it. The more he hates it, the more they like it. Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s government approached the Nafta negotiations as if it were dealing with Saudi Arabia or North Korea, making a show of bringing issues like gender equality and the environment to the table.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Actually, Mr. <b>Trump</b> is right about supply management and Canada's dairy industry. Getting rid of our 270% tariff on imported dairy goods would be a positive development for Canadian consumers tired of paying $12 for a wee bit of cheese.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But try telling someone struggling with <b>Trump</b> derangement syndrome that the current American president could be right about anything. Try pointing out to a Canadian who binges on <span class=\"companylink\">Netflix</span> that the programs he loves come courtesy of an American company.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Or try pointing out that every sufferer of Canadian TDS watches far more American cinema and television than the homegrown variety. Most probably own an Apple product or three. Painful as it is to admit, Canadians are actually quite fond of American stuff.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Odd, then, that another mutation of TDS causes some self-righteous Canadians to refuse to set foot in the U.S. for as long as Mr. <b>Trump</b> is president. I know people who, recently returned from living in China, proudly promise never to visit \"<b>Trump</b>'s America.\" I can't keep up with the number of friends, relatives and colleagues who have chosen to go to Cuba this winter rather than their usual Florida or South Carolina, giving the occupant of the White House as their reason.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Evidently vacationing in an island prison with no civil liberties is fine but a getaway to the land of the free is not.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The one cure for TDS, apparently, is extreme cold. After about three weeks of below-zero weather here in Toronto, a TDS carrier I know managed to shed his principles when the opportunity of an inexpensive week in a sunny Southern state appeared. Note to Mr. <b>Trump</b>: A few more weeks of winter and Canada might give you what you want on Nafta.</p>\n",

       " Andrew Scheer, the Conservative Party's teddy bear of a leader, has been likened to a kinder, gentler Stephen Harper. He should instead cast himself as a kinder, gentler Donald <b>Trump</b>. Scheer's style and his lifestyle, his temperament and his vocabulary, could not be more different than <b>Trump</b>'s. Yet where it matters most in politics, in policies that lead people to the voting booth, the two are surprisingly similar. With <b>Trump</b> increasingly seen as having a <span class=\"companylink\">Midas</span> touch on the economy - not only are U.S. median wages rising for the first time in decades, the U.S. GDP is growing as is global GDP, according to the <span class=\"companylink\">IMF</span> - Scheer would do well to define himself as someone who can do for the Canadian economy what <b>Trump</b> is doing for America's, and the world's.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Like <b>Trump</b>, Scheer has a social-conservative base that's evangelical, pro-life, touts home-schooling and promotes the traditional family. Like <b>Trump</b>, Scheer was an unabashed backer of Brexit, tapping into the nationalism that's sweeping much of the world. Like <b>Trump</b>, Scheer plays well in small towns and rural areas, and with median-income folks who haven't shared in the great prosperity of the one per cent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Like <b>Trump</b>, Scheer champions deregulation. Now that <b>Trump</b> has demonstrated that deregulation isn't an abstraction - his regulatory rollback was already boosting the U.S. economy even when it looked like Republican tax cuts might not happen - Scheer should be making <b>Trump</b>-like promises, like vows to cut two regulations for every new one that's enacted and reducing the time to approve new projects from 10 years to two. And - especially given the importance of energy policy to Canada's economy - getting the federal government to stop suffocating our viable energy industries and to stop resuscitating the renewables that are on perpetual life-support.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b>'s most sweeping deregulations have occurred in the energy area - from fast-tracking small-scale natural gas exports, to lowering the requirement that gasoline contain ethanol, to curtailing the tracking of greenhouse gas emissions, to stopping rules crippling fracking, to reducing penalties for automakers whose vehicles didn't meet fleet energy-efficiency standards, to ending the Clean Power Plan at the heart of the Paris climate agreement. Scheer can point to <b>Trump</b>'s success in these and other energy areas in touting his stance on what will likely be a major federal election issue next year: scrapping the carbonpricing policies the <b>Trudeau</b> government ushered in after winning an election by downplaying climate change reforms.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"The Conservative party of Canada under my leadership will always oppose a carbon tax,\" Scheer unequivocally states. \"It hits those hardest who can least afford it.\" The last time the Liberals ran unabashedly on climate change - Stéphane Dion's \"Green Shift\" campaign in 2008 - the party suffered its worst electoral defeat since Confederation. The Liberals stand to repeat that if Scheer can loudly trumpet his position that carbon pricing \"raises the cost of everything and puts jobs at risk while doing little for the environment.\" Conservatives everywhere - in Canada, in the U.S., in Australia - have time and again been winners when their opponents believed their own rhetoric and fought elections by vowing to price carbon.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Scheer's other deregulation proposals - including in telecom and financial services - also resonate stronger now that they echo <b>Trump</b>'s successes. And Scheer's proposals for tax cuts - details to come - should be game changers, in line with what <b>Trump</b>'s December tax cuts demonstrated. No sooner did Republican tax cuts pass Congress than corporations started distributing the windfall to their employees in a startling demonstration of trickle-down economics. To date, 275 major corporations have provided millions of workers with bonuses of US$1,000 to US$2,500 and/or hefty pay raises. The retailer Lowes is the latest corporation to join the trend. On Thursday it said it would give its 260,000 full-and part-time hourly workers bonuses of US$1,000. The U.S. tax collector is doing its part, too, by seizing a smaller share of the pay packet - starting this week, 90 per cent of Americans are receiving fatter paycheques, courtesy of <b>Trump</b>'s tax cuts.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">With a federal election in Canada coming in less than two years, the fundamentals look good for Scheer. Despite Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s celebrity and Scheer's obscurity, the Liberals are barely three per cent ahead of the Conservatives - 37 per cent to 33.8 per cent - according to the latest Nanos poll, just above the margin of error. As important, while the U.S. electorate is split between two dominant parties, Canada's electorate has a major third party, the NDP, that has the potential to bleed votes away from the Liberals, particularly as <b>Trudeau</b>'s star has waned with many of the millennials and lefties that put him in power. In a threeway race, Scheer may not need many more voters than his base to win the next election. But he may get them, as Canadian voters reflect on the boons their counterparts received south of the border.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> won big in the U.S. against all odds. Now that <b>Trump</b> has shown the way, the soft-spoken Scheer has the odds in his favour - a wind at his back thanks to <b>Trump</b>'s proven policies, and without the liability of <b>Trump</b>'s braggadocio.</p>\n",

       " </div><div class=\"author\">George Athanassakos </div><div>National Post</div>\n",
       " <div>848 words</div><div>2 February 2018</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All_but_Toronto</div><div>FP9</div><div>English</div><div>© 2018 National Post . All Rights Reserved. </div>\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A recent column in The Globe and Mail entitled \"The TSX isn't invited in the stock market party. Here's why\" questions why major indexes around the world including the U.S., Europe, Asia and emerging markets are posting doubledigit gains while the TSX is almost flat. The writer concludes that it has to do with the uncertainty surrounding <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> and weakness in commodity prices.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While there is some truth to this, in my opinion the TSX suffers from what I call the \"<b>Trudeau</b> Effect.\" Since the federal Liberal government was elected with a majority on Oct. 19, 2015, I decided to compare the performance of two large-cap and highly liquid ETFs, namely iShares S&amp;P;/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) in Canada and <span class=\"companylink\">SPDR S&amp;P; 500 ETF</span> (SPY) in the U.S., from January 2016 to the end of 2017, and, for comparison and control purposes, from January 2013 to end of 2014.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The annualized return of the Canadian ETF between Jan. 1, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2017 was 15.3 per cent versus 22.3 per cent for the U.S. ETF. However, from Jan. 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2017, the Canadian ETF rose by only 6.8 per cent versus 26.3 per cent for the U.S. And 2017 was a year of co-ordinated global expansion! The two years prior to 2015, a worse period for commodity stocks, XIU also underperformed SPY, but the underperformance was more typical of the long-run underperformance of Canadian indexes versus the U.S. equivalents. The annualized XIU return from Jan. 1, 2013 to the end of 2014 was 11.8 per cent versus 17.7 per cent for SPY; the corresponding returns from Jan. 1, 2014 to the end of 2014 were 12.5 per cent and 14.1 per cent, respectively.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In other words, the underperformance of the Canadian large-cap market has increased dramatically and incrementally since the beginning of 2016. And the underperformance of Canadian stocks has become even more severe over the last two to three months. Moreover, the correlation between the Canadian and U.S. markets, which was always quite high, has fallen somewhat since January 2016. The above evidence indicates a fundamental change in the Canadian economy in the last two years. Investors in Canadian equities originally gave the benefit of the doubt to the <b>Trudeau</b> government, but as reality about federal Liberal economic policies started to set in, the Canadian stock market started to severely underperform the U.S. equivalent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Maybe Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> is a nice guy, while the guy south of the border is not. But this is not and should not be a competition of who is nicer. It is about who is a better steward and manager of the economy. While U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b> has poor and declining poll numbers on whether he is a nice guy, his numbers on how well he manages the economy are high and have been improving. When <b>Trump</b> took office, 46 per cent of Americans polled said they had a positive impression of the state of the economy; in recent months the number has risen to 66 per cent according to a <span class=\"companylink\">Quinnipiac University</span> survey. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal agree.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Unlike <b>Trump</b>, <b>Trudeau</b> is a progressive prime minister who believes that corporations must be benevolent organizations that put workers before shareholders. He favours taxing corporations and the rich, and adding regulatory impediments and red tape to corporate activity. He is a big supporter of income redistribution as opposed to making the pie bigger for everyone. He wants to regulate the economy and nudge corporations to submit to his social views and economic philosophy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">An economy like Canada's cannot afford to be out of harmony with its major trading partners such as the U.S., China and Europe. Canada is a small fish in a big pond. <b>Trudeau</b>'s statements during his recent keynote speech at the <span class=\"companylink\">World Economic Forum</span> in Davos, namely that Canada will not be slashing taxes and regulatory tape to compete with the U.S., are not very helpful to Canada or encouraging to those considering investing in Canada. His speech promoting fairness and prosperity through taxes was nice in theory but reality is different. As baseball player Yogi Berra once said, \"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are different.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">All these policies hurt productivity and undermine the competitiveness of the Canadian economy. The stock market is a reflection of the economy and where the economy is headed. Canada's stock market performance does not bode well. Foreign investments in Canada have stalled partly because of the uncertainty regarding <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, but also because of the <b>Trudeau</b> Effect. Put them all together and one can understand why investors are voting with their feet.</p>\n",

Additionally, they have amassed a deportations backlog in foreign nationals found to be inadmissible to Canada,\" she said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Meanwhile, the Liberal government is now trying to get ahead of the incoming tide by deploying MPs to major U.S. cities with large communities of those most at risk of a <b>Trump</b>-inspired crackdown to try to counter misinformation spreading on social media about the ease of coming to Canada.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In a matter of hours last week, the careers of three high-profile Canadian politicians came crashing down after allegations surfaced against them of alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, Jamie Baillie resigned last Wednesday as Nova Scotia Conservative leader following an investigation by the party into a sexual harassment allegation against him.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Next, just a few hours later, Patrick Brown stunned the political world by quitting as Ontario Conservative party leader after CTV News reported two young women had accused him of sexual misconduct while he was a federal MP.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Then came Kent Hehr's sudden resignation as federal sport and disabilities minister after a woman accused him of using sexually suggestive language while he was an Alberta MPP.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The demise of all three men was swift, despite their denials of any wrongdoing.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So how come Donald <b>Trump</b>, possibly the worst sexual abuser ever elected in the U.S., survives all the sexual misconduct allegations against him? Has he no shame?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Indeed, last week, at the very time the Canadian political figures were being shunned and scorned, <b>Trump</b> was basking in the applause of rich, powerful business leaders at a high-priced international forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While Brown was accused by two young women, Teflon Donny has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by more than 20 women. He's also been caught on an infamous video boasting of sexually assaulting women and of grabbing them by their genitals.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And now there's the recent revelation that <b>Trump</b> had an affair with porn star Stormy Daniels four months after Melania, his wife, gave birth to their son. The Wall Street Journal has reported that <b>Trump</b> paid Daniels $130,000 (U.S.) in hush money to keep the affair secret.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Can you imagine how long Justin <b>Trudeau</b> would last if it was found that he had sex with an adult film star?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> isn't the only world leader to survive a series of sex scandals.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Bill Clinton survived despite his affairs with intern Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers, a former entertainer who spoke about being his mistress for 12 years.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In Italy, former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is staging a political comeback even though he is renowned for wild sex parties with young women, prostitutes and showgirls. The billionaire was forced to resign in 2011, not because of any sex scandal, but because of his handling of Italy's faltering economy. He is now leading a leftist coalition in the March 4 general election and may emerge as Italy's next prime minister.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In <b>Trump</b>'s case, none of the sex scandals have hurt him with his base of voters - and likely won't for the rest of his presidency.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Indeed, there are several explanations for why <b>Trump</b> is still in the White House, and not in political exile. The same reasons could apply to Clinton, Berlusconi and other politicians accused in such scandals.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, <b>Trump</b> shows no remorse, no personal guilt. He's never admitted any guilt on any of the allegations against him. Instead, he's called all the women liars, dismissed his infamous Access Hollywood tape as \"locker-room talk\" by the boys.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Second, unlike Al Franken, the Democratic senator from Minnesota who resigned in December after photos emerged of him groping a TV reporter during a USO tour before he was elected, <b>Trump</b> is unapologetic.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Third, he just keeps on fighting, turning the allegations into a partisan battle with the Democrats and accusing them of fanning the flames of unfounded allegations against him.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Fourth, the religious right that forms a huge part of <b>Trump</b>'s political base shows no sign of abandoning him. Instead of condemning him over his sex-related scandals, they have hypocritically turned a blind eye to his personal behaviour, unlike what they did with Clinton. Rather, what they like about <b>Trump</b> are his stands on abortion, contraceptive laws and gay issues.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Fifth, unlike our parliamentary system, there are few ways for a U.S. president to be dumped. Impeachment is one method, but it's a long and arduous path, especially when Republicans control Congress.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Sixth, Americans may be facing \"scandal fatigue\" with <b>Trump</b>, who has been in the news for decades because of his marriages, affairs, divorces, bankruptcies and more.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ultimately, the answer may lie with the simple fact that <b>Trump</b> has no shame.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Still, voters and politicians and the media in America should be constantly calling him to account. If they don't, <b>Trump</b> will continue to get away with actions that bring down other men.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada has ceded ground in the ongoing <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> talks. It has not ceded enough to satisfy U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If the federal Liberal government wants to keep a free-trade relationship with Washington, it will have to accept one that - in most cases - is markedly worse than the current <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That's the message from the latest round of bargaining in Montreal this week.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Specifically, Washington is standing firm on demands that more autos and auto parts be manufactured in the U.S., that the pact be subject to a five-year sunset clause and that <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19, which allows signatories to challenge one another's trade practices, be scrapped.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ottawa has tried various ploys to circumvent <b>Trump</b>'s intransigence. First, Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> launched a charm offensive to convince the prickly president that Canada is America's best friend.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> squired <b>Trump</b>'s daughter Ivanka to the theatre and gave the president a photo that showed him with the prime minister's late father, Pierre.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> was equally charming in return. But he didn't change his mind on <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Then the Canadians tried to circumvent <b>Trump</b> by lobbying state and federal politicians on the virtues of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. That didn't work either.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Then Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland tried logic, using America's own trade figures to prove that the U.S. has done well from <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> and his officials responded by using different trade figures - including Canadian ones - to prove the opposite.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Freeland politely pointed out to the U.S. side the seeming absurdity of some of their positions - such as demanding specific American content rules in a three-way free-trade deal that includes Canada and Mexico.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That didn't work either.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nor did Canada's decision to use the <span class=\"companylink\">World Trade Organization</span>'s dispute resolution system to challenge America's panoply of trade rules.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While justifiable (U.S. trade law is unusually self-serving) that decision just irritated the Americans.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On Monday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer slammed Canada for its <span class=\"companylink\">WTO</span> challenge. He said it only underscored the danger to U.S. national sovereignty posed by dispute resolution systems, such as the ones Canada wants to keep in <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In this just-completed round of bargaining, Freeland tried a new tack - proposing what she called creative compromises.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The U.S. had demanded, for instance, that member states have the right to opt out of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 11, which lets foreign companies challenge national laws before nonjudicial trade panels.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Canadian compromise, in effect, accepts the American proposal with the proviso that even if the U.S. opts out, Canada and Mexico would be able to determine their own Chapter 11 relationship.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">An American opt-out from Chapter 11 would be good for Canada, which far too often is on the losing side of these claims, and bad for U.S. firms which have tended to be the winners.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ironically, Canada is acting in its own interests by effectively agreeing to this particular U.S. demand. But as an added bonus, it may also have made some mischief between <b>Trump</b> and his business supporters.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On the auto front, Canada's creative comprise went nowhere. In essence, Canada had suggested that more elements, including marketing, be included as North American content under <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. If this were done, the percentage of U.S.-made content would automatically rise - thereby (the theory went) satisfying <b>Trump</b>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If <b>Trump</b> were the narcissistic buffoon he is often made out to be, if he were easily satisfied by paper victories, this sleight of hand might have worked. But Lighthizer at least seems to take the president seriously when he demands that trade deals benefit American workers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On Monday, the U.S. trade representative dismissed this auto compromise out of hand.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Freeland has said she takes <b>Trump</b> at his word. She should. On <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> at least he has been unusually consistent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He has called it the worst trade deal ever. He has said Canada and Mexico get too much from it and the U.S. too little. He has said that if <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> is to continue, the U.S. must get more while Canada and Mexico get less.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He may be entertaining mercantilist fallacies when he says this. He may be running afoul of accepted economic theory. But that is what he says and that is what he wants.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Freeland has also said that no deal is better than a bad deal. If the talks so far are any indication, the Liberals will eventually face that choice.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Senate of Canada is back in session this week, ready to vote on Bill C-25. That's the legislation introduced by Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains to revamp the Canada Business Corporations Act and inject more social subversion into corporate governance. Part of the bill deals with shareholders'election of directors. Another tackles the trending topic of diversity in management, on boards and throughout the corporate system.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In December there appeared to be some chance the bill's more extreme provisions would get amended and the bill returned to the Commons where, perchance, it might meet a peaceful demise. No such luck. When the risk emerged that the focus of the prime minister's talking points at the <span class=\"companylink\">World Economic Forum</span> might end up as mulch on the floor of the Senate, the Liberal power machine shut down the banking committee's review of the legislation. So much for the independence of the newly independent Liberal senators.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">At the Davos event, where U.S. President <b>Trump</b> sold America as a low-tax nation open for investment, <b>Trudeau</b> offered a down-with-corporations speech dedicated to genderism, diversity and intersectionality. \"We have to recognize that aspects of intersectionality are always at play and require special attention,\" he said. \"Here's an example: In 2016, among women who were newly appointed to the boards of Fortune 500 companies, 77 per cent of them were white. Race, religion, sexuality, socioeconomic status - these are just a few of the ways that women are even further discriminated against.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When he wasn't playing the race/sex/religion/inequality card in Davos, <b>Trudeau</b> laced into corporate greed. \"Too many corporations have put the pursuit of profit before the wellbeing of their workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering. All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand, while slashing benefits with the other. But that approach can't and won't cut it anymore.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead, what Canada and the world need is more social corporatism. To support his gender and diversity mission, <b>Trudeau</b> cited a <span class=\"companylink\">McKinsey Global Institute</span> report as evidence that \"narrowing the gender gap in Canada would add $150 billion to our economy by 2026.\" He also claimed a study by the <span class=\"companylink\">Peterson Institute for International Economics</span> in Washington showed that increasing the number of women in leadership positions from zero to 30 per cent \"translates into a 15-per-cent boost in profitability.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> failed to note that the Peterson conclusion came with a qualifier: \"This estimate, derived from a cross-section, may well diminish if re-estimated in a panel setting and is surely subject to diminishing returns. Nevertheless, the robustness of this result from a global dataset warrants further study.\" A study that \"warrants further study\" is no reason to rush to regulate.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The McKinsey estimate of a $150-billion gain in Canada's GDP by 2026 is another a piece of research that warrants further study. The number flows out of a 2015 <span class=\"companylink\">McKinsey Global Institute</span> report titled \"The Power of Parity: How Advancing Women's Equality Can Add $12 Trillion to Global Growth.\" Among the McKinsey senior execs advising the hundreds of researchers around the world who worked on The Power of Parity was Dominic Barton, who now heads <b>Trudeau</b>'s Advisory Council on Economic Growth.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The McKinsey global report sets a global standard for policy-based evidence making. What would happen to global growth, asks the report, if women participated in the economy identically to men? To find the answer, Mc-Kinsey engaged in what the report describes as a \"thought experiment\" in which women have the \"same\" labour participation rates as men and the \"same\" hours worked in each sector of the global economy and are equally productive. This \"thought experiment\" produced a global GDP gain of $28 trillion by 2026.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But full gender parity, said McKinsey, is an \"aspiration\" that needed to be tweaked to something more realistic. The trimmed-down result was a $12-trillion global GDP gain.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There were no specific numbers for Canada in the original report. So after Barton became head of <b>Trudeau</b>'s advisory council, McKinsey in 2017 added a Canada-only thought experiment.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Canadian report claimed that a full gender-parity regime - same work, same hours, same productivity - could produce a GDP gain of $420 billion by 2026. That being impossible, the report compromised with the more modest objective of merely increasing gender equality rather than going for full parity. The economic modelling here is dubious. Other researchers have found that such gender-based analyses by consultants and advocates are unreliable and unscientific.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Also questionable is the proposed imposition of a rash of social-engineering initiatives, including quota settings, subsidies, child-care schemes, enhanced diversity propaganda, hiring preferences and other measures to overcome the complex social, economic and cultural structures - good and bad - that produce Canada's current and supposedly inequitable economic divisions.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">New gender and diversity rules are constantly being invented. A recent op-ed co-written by Dominic Barton suggested corporate procurement departments should expand programs that \"aim to purchase from women - and minority-owned businesses.\" <b>Trudeau</b> in Davos had more ideas. When companies are looking for a new hire they \"should be identifying women candidates at a rate equal to men.\" When corporations and governments need to fill appointments, said <b>Trudeau</b>, they should \"recruit people who reflect the true diversity of our country.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In weeks to come, the Senate will debate and pass Bill C-25, a product of the McKinsey report on Canada that promises a $150-billion windfall. We may never see the gains, but we will certainly experience the social divisiveness that is at the heart of the politics of diversity.</p>\n",

       " Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s speech last week to the <span class=\"companylink\">World Economic Forum</span> in Davos was one of the most striking attacks on economic globalization by a Canadian prime minister in recent memory.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Speaking of \"the importance of progressive values in the context of globalization,\" <b>Trudeau</b> was in full form as a tireless and righteous defender of the middle class.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In an astoundingly jaw-dropping display of his anti-corporatist world view, <b>Trudeau</b> lectured his listeners on the apparent realities of the current global landscape.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"Companies avoid taxes and post record profits with one hand,\" <b>Trudeau</b> said, \"while slashing benefits with the other.\" For those who still believe the fallacy that the Liberals under <b>Trudeau</b> represent a \"centrist\" solution in the Canadian political landscape, <b>Trudeau</b>'s Davos speech should be an eye opener.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is no doubt <b>Trudeau</b> should be unequivocally commended for his strong calls for greater gender parity in the workplace, a theme that formed the skeleton of his Davos speech. But on the topic of globalization, <b>Trudeau</b>'s views should terrify anyone who really cares about the growth of the middle class and the ability of the private sector to foster that growth.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Simply put, <b>Trudeau</b>'s views on globalization are wrong.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Contrary to the anti-globalist rhetoric advanced by politicians such Jeremy Corbyn on the left or Donald <b>Trump</b> on the right, the \"middle class\" has never been better off. In a 2017 report, the prestigious <span class=\"companylink\">Brookings Institution</span> suggested that, by 2020, the global middle class will represent the majority of our planet's population for the first time ever.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Perhaps even more striking is the report's claim that, for the next five years, roughly 160 million people will join the middle class every single year. \"At a global level,\" the report says, \"we are witnessing the most rapid expansion of the middle class the world has ever seen.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That's roughly four-and-a-half times the population of Canada entering the global middle class in a single year. And that's four-and-a-half times the population of Canada that will have better access to education, better access to health care, and a greater shot at a life of dignity and security. Hardly a failure of capitalism, if you ask me.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Notwithstanding the fact that <b>Trudeau</b> is generally seen as embodying a set of modern and contemporary ideals, his Davos speech did little more than highlight his commitment to the antiquated view that the state must play an overwhelming role in public life.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If you doubt this, consider for a moment the growth of the state in the Canadian economy since the Liberals came to power. From a federal carbon tax to an expanded Canada Pension Plan to new legislation that aims to expand diversity in the workplace (Bill C-25) to a more generous <span class=\"companylink\">Universal</span> Child Care Benefit, the <b>Trudeau</b> Liberals appear intent on rewriting the rules of Canada's economic landscape.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And with our country currently holding the G7 presidency, the platform is there for <b>Trudeau</b> to continue pushing this approach at the global level, as he seems to have already done with the recent signing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> has made the growth of the middle class his government's central priority, using this goal to justify the Liberals'various attempts to expand its reach. At Davos, <b>Trudeau</b> spoke extensively of the need for governments to more effectively address the voices of marginalized populations, rightly citing the rise of populism as a threat to global stability.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But rather than pointing the finger at corporations or the global economic system - effectively replacing one form of fact-flexible populism with another - <b>Trudeau</b> would be wise to remember the recent growth of the global middle class has been enabled in part by nearly three decades of governments around the world willingly shrinking their reach in favour of greater economic liberalism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Strange that such incredible growth could have taken place in an era when companies are apparently behaving so badly.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's hard not to recognize that Canada has become a less-appealing place to do business over the last number of years. Higher taxes, new regulations and uncertainty over access to foreign markets - that is, the ability to trade - have reduced Canada's attractiveness to entrepreneurs and businesses. Indeed, Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> in a recent speech at Davos said his government would not respond to Canada's sudden lack of business-tax competitiveness due to the <b>Trump</b> tax cuts. As we approach budget season, governments across Canada must start paying attention to competitiveness.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The list of made-in-Canada policies that have reduced our competitiveness is long and substantial. Most provinces and the federal government, for instance, have increased personal income-tax rates on professionals, entrepreneurs and business owners.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In addition, large deficits in Ottawa and in many provinces have created uncertainty about additional future tax increases. Indeed, the federal government has not ruled out additional tax hikes on capital gains, stock options and personal income.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And despite the United States rejecting a national carbon tax, Canada continues to charge forward with its plan for national carbon pricing, which will place several Canadian industries at a distinct disadvantage compared to our competitors.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ontario's push for greenenergy alternatives, which is now being replicated in other provinces, has dramatically increased electricity prices (the primary cost for many businesses, particularly manufacturers), hurt Ontario's economy and reduced competitiveness.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Beyond these damaging policy changes, there's also the strong anti-business rhetoric from Ottawa and many provincial capitals. Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, for instance, has used extraordinarily confrontational language to describe the government's intent to \"go after\" certain \"professionals and wealthy people.\" We should not underestimate the negative effects of such language toward businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Add to the domestic policy follies and anti-business rhetoric two significant headwinds from the United States.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, the chances of a positive completion of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> renegotiations look doubtful. Insiders have expressed frustration and in some cases outright dismay at Canada's approach to <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> and our attempts at trade negotiations with China.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Second, the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. government</span> passed sweeping tax reform in December, which means for the first time in more than two decades, our southern neighbour will have lower business-tax rates than we do.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In response, Canadian governments, particularly the federal government, have done nothing to signal to investors, entrepreneurs and businesses that they have a plan to return the country to competitiveness.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Governments across the country have reverted to repeating political talking points that reforms are working to improve the economy, and employed a \"head in the sand\" approach to both trade and tax competitiveness.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While Canada enjoyed a slight bump in economic growth at the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017, the general economic data aren't all that strong. For example, employment growth since 2014 has totalled 3.5 per cent. However, almost one in three of those jobs were created in the public sector, which grew 4.8 per cent compared to just 3.2 per cent for the private sector.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The main reason for the weak private-sector job creation is the dismal state of business investment. Since peaking in the fourth quarter of 2014, every category of business investment has declined except for residential housing. Total business investment excluding residential structures (adjusted for inflation) is down almost 20 per cent. Investment in machinery and equipment has declined in six of the 12 quarters since the end of 2014, resulting in a total decline of almost 10 per cent. A recent <span class=\"companylink\">Fraser Institute</span> analysis by Philip Cross, former chief analyst at <span class=\"companylink\">Statistics Canada</span>, determined that Canada ranked second-last among 17 industrialized countries for business investment.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Given the weakness in the private sector, it shouldn't be surprising to learn that the federal <span class=\"companylink\">Department of Finance</span> forecasts economic growth to average just 1.8 per cent to 2055. The expectation for future growth pales in comparison to the average historical rate of 2.4-per-cent growth recorded between 1980 and 2016.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ignoring external threats and continuing to implement policies that discourage rather than encourage entrepreneurs, investors and businesses will not solve Canada's immediate and future economic challenges. Indeed, this approach is making things worse. Competitiveness must take centre stage as the provinces and federal government present their economic and financial plans starting next month.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Folks, we give you Doug Ford. Remember him?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Please don't stop reading. We can explain the inexplicable — starting with his declaration Monday to seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives and become Ontario's next premier.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The June 7 election was supposed to be a chance for voters to pass judgment on Kathleen Wynne and her Liberal government.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A referendum, remember? Focused on Liberal failures.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Tories assumed they'd win on the strength of Wynne's weaknesses. No matter who was leading their party.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Now, the opposition PCs have had the tables turned on them — by themselves. The next election looks like a referendum on the opposition Tories as they turn themselves inside out with a bitterly contested leadership race.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And a hard-fought battle to chop up a key plank of the party platform: Yes, “Axe the (carbon) tax.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Until last week, it mattered little who led the party, but all that changed when Patrick Brown was publicly disgraced in an alleged sex scandal. Suddenly leaderless, the PC caucus quickly rallied around their most popular and qualified[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/01/26/did-progressive-conservatives-just-give-away-the-game.html] MPP, urging the party to confirm their choice to lead them into the next election.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Vic Fedeli. Remember him?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That was Friday lunchtime. By suppertime, in a bizarre power play, PC party president Rick Dykstra and his executive basically told caucus — you know, the elected MPPs who face voters every four years — to go fornicate themselves.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That left Fedeli serving as the unchallenged PC leader for a day, until his own party executive downgraded him to interim chief of a disrespected caucus. With the start of the election barely 100 days away, Dykstra opened the door to <span class=\"companylink\">Ford</span> and all other pretenders to the throne to party on at the party's expense.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">By Sunday, Dykstra — an ex-MP who got the job after Brown intervened[https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/03/03/cohn-can-ontario-pcs-revive-the-big-blue-machine-amid-liberal-blues.html] on behalf of his old pal — was himself decapitated, felled by the sexual impropriety virus that has become contagious, incubating for years before emerging with virulence. Over four days the party changed leaders, shortchanged its new leader, and then lost its president.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The executive wanted a wide open leadership race, and it got one — an epic war of egregious egos.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Behold a hostile takeover by Ford Nation, a coronation of Caroline Mulroney (daughter of a former PM), a revival of the social conservative faction (MPP Monte McNaughton), or any other unknowns (for example Rod Phillips, a corporate type playing to type). Unless Tories opt for the restoration of sanity and stability under Fedeli, the comeback kid.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The question isn't whether <span class=\"companylink\">Ford</span> is up to the job of leader — anyone can apply, provided they survive the vetting process that will surely be put in place after the Brown fiasco. The real question is whether the 200,000 PC members across the province will fall for the anti-elitist, anti-gravy-train sloganeering made famous by the <span class=\"companylink\">Ford</span> brothers when one of them was mayor.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " <span class=\"companylink\">Ford</span> will score big points by attacking the proposed carbon tax that is a centrepiece of the PC platform, brought in over heavy opposition from the rank and file. “Axe the tax” will be his battle cry, forcing all the other candidates to respond.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Will the grassroots fall under the spell of Mulroney, about whom we know everything[https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolinelapham/] and nothing — except that she has lived and worked so much of her adult life in the U.S. (Hello Michael Ignatieff), and has been studiously avoiding major media outlets? To date, her political persona exists primarily as a Twitter bot periodically tweeting out an “Official Statement” — official in what capacity remains unclear — condemning sexual transgressions or demanding an open leadership race. Calls by media colleagues go unanswered — no questions, please.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is a thin line between celebrity and notoriety for a Mulroney — it's hard to know whether her family name will work wonders in a province where Brian ended up unloved as PM. It worked well enough for Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, but his late father was rather more popular in Ontario, and he wisely waited several years to grow into the job of MP before running for leader — and then seasoning himself well ahead of an election campaign.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is also Rod Phillips, a former Postmedia and CivicAction chair little known beyond the boardrooms of Toronto and, like Mulroney, his boundless ambition untested in political combat. Or McNaughton, the MPP who may once again give voice to the social conservative crowd that backed Brown when he opposed any update of Ontario's sex-ed curriculum (after all, why educate teenagers about the right of consent to better equip them against the kinds of allegations we've been hearing about?).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Perhaps all of these contenders and pretenders will find a way to finesse their embrace of the party platform while <span class=\"companylink\">Ford</span> dismantles it plank by plank — starting with the deeply unpopular PC carbon tax. Doubtless, all are confident they can take on <span class=\"companylink\">Ford</span>, just like all those Republicans — not least Jeb Bush, heir to another great political dynasty — boasted they'd put Donald <b>Trump</b> in his place in the primaries. Remember him?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Let the horse race begin. Let the PC platform and chariots be rebuilt.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Get ready for the next election campaign, 100 days away. Just don't expect a referendum on the Liberals alone.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Jan. 29, 2017 must be remembered as the date of the worst mass murder to take place in a house of worship in Canadian history. This was the day when six Muslim men were shot dead after evening prayers in a Quebec City mosque.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A local halal grocery store owner, a professor at <span class=\"companylink\">Universite Laval</span>, three civil servants and a pharmacy worker were brutally slain that night. They originally came from Morocco, Algeria and Guinea. They were fathers, sons, husbands, brothers and respected members of the local Muslim community.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Remember their names: Ibrahima Barry (aged 39), Mamadou Tanou Barry (aged 42), Khaled Belkacemi (aged 60), Aboubaker Thabti (aged 44), Abdelkrim Hassane (aged 41) and Azzedine Soufiane (aged 57).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">One year later, it is time to pause and reflect on some of the lessons we must learn from this tragedy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Lesson 1: The alibi of white exceptionalism</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While condemned as a terrorist attack by many, including Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, the accused shooter, Alexandre Bissonnette, a 26-year-old student from <span class=\"companylink\">Universite Laval</span>, faces first-degree murder charges but has not been charged with any terrorism crimes. Legal experts have said sections of the Criminal Code dealing with terrorism are aimed at those who commit the crime in collaboration with a terrorist group, meaning it's difficult to prosecute a lone gunman.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yet others were quick to point out that when the assailant is Muslim, the same consideration is rarely extended, lone wolf or not. In fact, the first suspect in the Quebec shooting was a Moroccan man, Mohamed Belkhadir, who was in the mosque during the attack and called police who then misidentified him as a suspect.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This goes to show how easily and routinely Muslims are associated with criminality and terror. The consequences of this kind of labelling as suspect is felt by all Muslims. When a lone Muslim commits a crime, the burden of guilt is collectively levelled against all other Muslims who suffer the backlash. The same is not true for white perpetrators and their communities.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Part of the privilege of whiteness is the exceptionalism that allows white people to be regarded as individuals in that their actions will not, by association, affect the status or safety of others from their group.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Whiteness is an alibi that allows a mass murderer to be the bad apple that spoils the bunch, instead of painting all white people as potentially violent and criminal, even though lone white men are most typically engaged in mass shootings.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">All Muslims, however, must contend with being labelled as potential radicals, jihadis and threats to the nation even when — as in the case of the mosque killings — they are the victims.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Lesson 2: Islamophobia is “home grown”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Quebec massacre was a shock to Canada's multicultural utopia. And yet some of us wondered how this had not happened sooner. Canada's “home grown” Islamophobia had impacted Muslims long before this tragedy made it a headline.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Liberal multiculturalism has long masked the inequality behind the Canadian “cultural mosaic” that was rightly characterized by sociologist John Porter as a “vertical mosaic” stratified along the lines of class as well as racial, ethnic and religious difference.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For example, a 2017 Angus Reid survey found 43 per cent of Canadians had unfavourable views of Islam as compared to other faiths, while a 2016 Leger poll found a steady decline in Francophone views of Islam since 2012, with 48 per cent of Quebec respondents holding negative views. <span class=\"companylink\">Statistics Canada</span> found hate crimes against Muslims in Canada grew 253 per cent in four years.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It is not insignificant to note that in the same mosque where the attack occurred, a pig's head with a sign that said “bon appétit” was left at the door a year before.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">After the massacre, Motion 103 was tabled by Liberal MP Iqra Khalid to address Islamophobia, systemic racism and religious discrimination, and implement measures to research, document and challenge these concerns. This was met with virulent Islamophobic rhetoric and hate.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">All of this came as an affront to Muslims who had barely had time to grieve the horror of the massacre before dealing with the onslaught of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Lesson 3: White nationalism and the myth of Canadian exceptionalism</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There was a rush to blame this tragedy on anti-Muslim hatred south of the border, exemplified by U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b>'s travel ban on Muslim countries and fortified by his Islamophobic rhetoric. Canadian's confidence in their exceptionalism — the idea that Canada is less racist and Islamophobic than the U.S — was secured by this move.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But relying solely on Trumpism as source of the problem denies the fact that Canada has its own history of policies that promote Islamophobia.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Harper era was riddled with “<b>Trump</b> Lite” policies that target Muslims, such as the Barbaric Cultural Practices Act, Security Certificates (involving secret evidence and trials), the Anti-Terrorism Act and the proposed niqab ban at citizenship ceremonies (all still exist except the niqab ban at citizenship ceremonies). Not to mention: Harper's unfounded comment about radicalization taking place in “basements” or “mosques”, which legitimized Islamophobic fears and anxieties and heightened suspicion toward religious spaces through dog whistle politics.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Quebec's policies, such Bill 94 banning the niqab from public and civic spaces and the Charter of Values, also contributed to this breeding ground of Islamophobic fear and white angst. Such policies and rhetoric north and south of the border served to embolden and authorize the views of white nationalist groups who have found renewed currency in this political climate.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There are approximately 100 white supremacist groups operating in Canada. Hate groups that specifically target Islam include <span class=\"companylink\">PEGIDA</span>, Never Again Canada, Rise Canada, Jewish Defense League, the Canadian Coalition of Concerned Citizens, while in Quebec, groups like La Muete promote hatred and fear of the sharia bogeyman].</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Stepping out of the shadows of internet chat rooms and congregating openly through public rallies across Canada over the past year, the presence of white supremacist nationalism is gaining renewed impetus through Islamophobic hate. A recent study on the white nationalist website Stormfront found that Islamophobic sentiments were more prominent from Canadian subscribers than in the U.S. The veneer of Canadian exceptionalism is stripped bare by such facts.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Lesson 4: Fear and moral panic</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Muslims have been constructed as the “enemies within” and represent the new folk devils that threaten the stability of the nation, a role other ethno-racial groups in Canada have played in the past.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The spread of Islamophobic fear and moral panic provide the ideological breeding ground for both right-wing populism and neo-fascism, as well for the recruitment efforts of extremist groups like Daesh/ISIS and Al Qaeda that rely on Islamophobia to set the stage for attracting disaffected youth to their cause. These conditions legitimate draconian security policies and racial and religious profiling that continue the vicious cycle of vilification, provocation and violence.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Lesson 5: Courage, resilience and solidarity</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Amid the violent chaos of the gunshots in the mosque, some escaped death but were left with debilitating injuries. Aymen Derbali was paralyzed after trying to stop the shooting. He is a hero and his selflessness saved lives. Others are emotionally and psychologically scarred by the trauma.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yet in a spirit of resilience, they have joined survivors of the Montreal Polytechnique massacre in 1989 in raising awareness of gun violence.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This massacre will continually haunt the nation's history. Yet the moments of sharing solidarity, interfaith support, mourning, and outrage with other Canadians has been healing. The vigils and memorials help to restore the sense of community that was shattered by this tragedy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The National Council of Canadian Muslims, with the support of over 70 Canadian Muslim associations and organizations and over two dozen community partners, are calling for Jan. 29 to be designated as a National Day of Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia. Having other Canadians support this effort will go a long way to ensuring that the lessons learned from this tragedy will not be forgotten.</p>\n",

In other words, <b>Trump</b>'s speech here at the <span class=\"companylink\">World Economic Forum</span> was a resounding success.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">O.K., fact-checkers found at least two falsehoods, and the audience booed when <b>Trump</b> went off script and raged at ''how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be.'' Yet on the whole, he read an anodyne speech perfectly well off the teleprompter, making it a personal triumph for him -- albeit also probably the weakest speech delivered by any leader in Davos this year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The past week has underscored how much the world needs American leadership, and how badly <b>Trump</b> is falling short -- or, more precisely, when he provides leadership, it's often in the wrong direction, setting us back.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The upshot is that there's now a global vacuum of practical and moral leadership.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There are challenges from North Korea to Yemen, from climate to refugees, plus atrocities in Myanmar that probably amount to genocide. South Sudan is collapsing, and in Syria, 16 bombings of hospitals or clinics have been reported just since Christmas -- and barely an eyebrow has been raised.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> is a gift to the world's tyrants in two important ways. First, he doesn't typically stand up to them.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">With the U.S. in retreat, there's no one who can fill the gap.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Angela Merkel, who in Davos called right-wing populism a ''poison'' and warned against erecting walls, is struggling in Germany to form a coalition government. Prime Minister Theresa May is a hobbled leader of a diminished Britain. Xi Jinping brutalized the only Nobel Peace Prize laureate China has ever had. India is unhelpful even with the Myanmar crisis in its neighborhood. Brazil and South Africa are in political chaos. And Vladimir Putin is too busy interfering with elections outside Russia or stealing bits of Ukraine to lead anything.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's prime minister, Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, gave a powerful speech in Davos challenging attendees to promote women and address pay inequity, family planning and child care to help women flourish. But <b>Trudeau</b> can be more of a talker than a doer; he has been less generous with foreign aid than his predecessor.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So <b>Trump</b> is all there is. Alas, he's not in the business of solving global problems, but of creating them.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's not quite right to say that <b>Trump</b> is providing no leadership. <b>Trump</b> is ''protecting'' us from refugees, but not from Russian manipulation of elections. He tries to ''protect'' us with a Muslim ban, but not from gun violence.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">One of the lesser-noted moments in Michael Wolff's behind-the-scenes book on the <b>Trump</b> presidency comes when Reince Priebus, the much-maligned chief of staff, throws in the towel and approaches Donald <b>Trump</b> on Air Force One to offer his resignation.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> tells him to take his time. \"You tell me what works for you,\" he says. \"Let's make it good.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Minutes later the plane lands, Priebus steps out and discovers <b>Trump</b> has already tweeted his departure and the name of his replacement, who also hasn't been notified of the change.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the wacky world of Trumpdom it's barely worth noticing, but it underlines the challenge Canada, and much of the rest of the trading world, faces in seeking certainty from an administration embroiled in perpetual confusion.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The problem is that, a year into <b>Trump</b>'s administration, it has become clear that nothing he says can be trusted. He may say one thing one moment, then tweet the opposite seconds later. If you accept the portrait penned by Wolff - and reportedly reflected in less sensational terms in a forthcoming book by media critic Howard Kurtz - the people around the president are in a constant state of mystification as to what he may say next, whether to take his latest words seriously, whether to act on his demands and whether he himself knows what he wants, other than constant praise and approval. Words spill out, but they don't necessarily carry any meaning.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This is a problem for those who, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, seek to represent presidential policy while ever in danger of being publicly contradicted and castigated.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The challenge for Canada is to prepare for whatever outcome prevails, even as the goalposts keep moving. The <b>Trudeau</b> government is clearly making attempts: after bungling a TPP session in Vietnam at which agreement was expected, Ontario, by far the biggest economy, is mired in debt and dangerously vulnerable to disruption of the trade links that tie it so closely to U.S. markets. Yet its unpopular government continues to move resolutely to the left in search of votes, piling on new taxes, restrictions, wage hikes and friendly labour laws bound to diminish its attraction to investors, even as the recent U.S. tax overhaul sharply increases its competitive advantages. <span class=\"companylink\">J.P. Morgan Chase and Co</span>. said Wednesday it will spend $20 billion on U.S. investment over five years, solely from the gains it garnered in the tax overhaul. It is only one of many that see renewed appeal in its home market, a fact Canada seems slow in grasping.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is little evidence Finance Minister Bill Morneau is preparing for the growing threat to Canadian competitiveness.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We'll have to take him at his word, since there's no evidence to back it up. If <b>Trump</b> manages to stay in office until the end of his term, Ottawa needs to be prepared for an ongoing roller-coaster of uncertainty, which could quickly torpedo all its warm assurances about its devotion to championing the middle class. Now would be a good time to start.</p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">You know your political career is over when a CTV story[https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/politics/patrick-brown-denies-sexual-misconduct-allegations-from-two-women-resigns-as-ontario-pc-leader-1.3774686#_gus&amp;_gucid=&amp;_gup=twitter&amp;_gsc=q3hAGjQ] comes out with a major unflattering adjacency: your name next to the words “his erection.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In politics, you should be so far away from this normally cheerful possessive + noun that you can't get cellphone reception. Any distant hilly country will do.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Voters can cope with erections of bus shelters and soccer nets — by all means, put them up — but not in the context of ex-PC leader Patrick Brown, sober, in his bedroom allegedly forcing himself on top of an 18-year-old who said she was drunk. She said she could feel it on her thigh. As for asking a high school girl for oral sex, yes, the word appears again.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">His campaign advisers and party staffers were wise to push him out. Columnists who think he was hard done by should quarrel with them, not blame the victims. Those men and women should have de-planed him when courageous PC MPP Lisa MacLeod told other officials in December of other stories about Brown's sexual conduct. She was told the rumours were “unfounded,” but she had done her bit. And as we know now, Brown was notorious among young women in the Barrie bar that he frequented “like a peacock.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It was nearly 10 p.m. Wednesday when Brown first spoke to reporters, then ran away. Even his new haircut[https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/11/25/who-is-patrick-brown-the-ontario-pc-leader-opens-up-about-life-love-and-his-new-haircut-as-a-june-election-looms.html] appeared to be fleeing from the head that was emitting the scabrous things he said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Everyone will have their own opinion on the worst part of Brown's initial tearful speech promising to get his lawyers involved after allegations from the two women, one of them a teen who said he took his, well, his erection, and asked for oral sex.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">My breaking point was Brown's simulated incredulity that he could ever be guilty of such a thing. “I have two younger sisters who are my best friends!” We've all heard sexually harassing men say they have wives and daughters — well, maybe they don't say that so much since <b>Trump</b> — but if the best you can come up with is that your sisters like you, you're the kind of pol who thinks putting pink frills on his highway billboards will win the female vote. #GalStrong in #SimcoeNorth.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Brown is hiding behind women's skirts, and at this point, voters will suspect he's just there to take upskirting photos. Everything Brown has said or done in the leaving of his job has been “textbook generic” for a creep, to use Stormy Daniels's phrase for what Donald <b>Trump</b> did to her in bed. I'm being told that more people have just left my column shrieking at the mental image.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Brown says he'll remain as MPP, presumably for the office space if he decides to conduct lawsuits against the two brave women. I can't imagine the courage it took for them to come forward against Brown. The same goes for the woman who faced down against ex-Nova Scotia PC leader Jamie Baillie, who just lost his leadership for the same reason.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Now according to Missouri Senate candidate Courtland Sykes, women like us are “career-obsessed banshees” and “nail-biting manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils” making up things “in their own nasty snake-filled heads.” Americans do take it up a notch, don't they?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But the effect is the same. With men like this in power, traumatized women lose their jobs, fall silent. Who knows? Brown may think these things and his followers on <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span> definitely do — of course thought is free — but no one in Canadian politics thinks them out loud.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Then again, there's Kent Hehr, federal Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities, just removed from cabinet by Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>. Alberta public servant Kristin Raworth said publicly that when Hehr was an MLA, she was warned on her first day of work at the Legislature not to get on an elevator with him. “You're yummy,” he told her. She said he made “verbally suggestive comments” to other women.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In 2017, Hehr ridiculed[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2017/12/07/wanted-a-disabilities-minister-sensitive-to-the-needs-of-others.html] a group of “thalidomiders,” women with bodies damaged by thalidomide.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Order of Canada member Fiona Sampson was in Hehr's office speaking for the thalidomiders. As she said later in a news conference, they told Hehr they would die early. He said that would be a bargain for the government. When they asked him for help, he sneered and said, “Well you don't have it so bad. Everyone in Canada has a sob story.” He even grabbed one thalidomider's arm at breast-level. She is a fragile woman, missing one leg and some internal organs, but she stood up to Hehr.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He allegedly insulted another woman, Jennifer McCrea[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/12/07/disabilities-minister-kent-hehr-apologizes-for-condescending-remark-to-calgary-mom.html], who approached the minister on a question of maternity benefits, by joking about wife-beating. He seems to enjoy tormenting and humiliating women.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Hehr has resigned[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/25/kent-hehr-resigns-from-cabinet-amid-allegations-of-inappropriate-sexual-remarks.html] from cabinet pending an investigation. He had no business being there in the first place. The fact that he's in a wheelchair was one reason to appoint him — he surely would understand others' pain — but instead he enjoyed inflicting it. Science Minister Kirsty Duncan will take over his job to which, I assume, he'll never return. Like Brown, he'll keep his day job, not much comfort to the women in the building.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And in other news, Larry Nassar[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/01/24/more-than-160-women-say-larry-nassar-sexually-abused-them-here-are-his-accusers-in-their-own-words.html], the pedophile doctor who sexually assaulted more than 150 women and little girls in the <span class=\"companylink\">USA Gymnastics</span> program will go to jail for life, while some felt the judge's comments were demeaning to the defendant.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There's a joke that used to circulate around Parliament Hill about what to expect at political party conventions, and it went something like this:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">You go to a Conservative convention to get drunk, a Liberal convention to get laid, and a New Democratic Party convention to get pamphlets.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the current climate, that is less of a joke than an ad for the NDP.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Alcohol and sex used to be standard features of the political trade — workplace perks or occupational hazards, depending on your perspective. In 2018, though, the smart move is to stick with the pamphlets.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The exploded career of Patrick Brown[https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2018/01/24/tory-leader-patrick-brown-denies-allegations-of-misconduct.html], former leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative party, is also another, lurid illustration of how things can go terribly wrong when you mix politics and alcohol — even when the politician, like Brown, is a teetotaller.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Actually, that's not a rare thing for a political leader these days either. President Donald <b>Trump</b> doesn't drink at all[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/30/trumps-sobering-ignorance-about-addiction.html]; former prime minister Stephen Harper was also an abstainer. The current prime minister, Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, enjoys the occasional glass of bourbon, but isn't a big imbiber of alcohol. “We were never people who were attracted to drugs and stuff that made us disconnect from our state of mind,” Sophie Grégoire <b>Trudeau</b>, his wife, told me in an interview back in 2013.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Though the prime minister was featured drinking wine in a recent National Post interview, bars aren't his natural habitat. The same is true for Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (a non-drinker, too).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Little wonder that the bar scene around Parliament Hill is a mere shadow of what it used to be: the old hangouts, like the Press Club or Hy's, long gone. Beer machines disappeared from the Press Gallery offices in the 1990s, along with the little store in the basement of Parliament Hill where you could pick up a bottle of wine to bring home or back to the office. The old Press Gallery dinner, once a drunken blur for politician and journalist attendees, is now really about the speeches — hard to distinguish from another day at the office.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yes, a lot of the modern age of political temperance is due to the crackdown on MPs' expense accounts, and the new era of public transparency around bar and restaurant bills. The two-martini lunch died with the 20th century, along with smoking in restaurants. Social media has also threatened to shine a spotlight on politicians who spend too much time around bars.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But it's also because alcohol and power, each addictive on their own, are a toxic combination when mixed with politics and sex. This coming age of zero tolerance for sexual harassment may soon be combined with zero tolerance for alcohol around politics — if we aren't there already.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We've already come to see alcohol as an obstacle on the Canadian political career ladder; something you need to regularly refuse if you plan to get ahead.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Two high-profile members of <b>Trudeau</b>'s team have sought treatment for alcohol abuse, we'll recall, since the Liberals came to power. For one, Hunter Toooo,[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/01/trudeau-says-it-was-mp-hunter-tootoos-own-choice-to-leave-cabinet-caucus.html] it was part of his journey out of cabinet. For the other, Seamus O'Regan, it led to a recovery that earned him a ministerial promotion[https://www.thespec.com/news-story/7525182-seamus-o-regan-becoming-veterans-minister-as-prime-minister-shuffles-cabinet/] last summer.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Apart from everything else we learned about Brown's downfall this week, one thing is clear: he'd probably still be in his job if he had not frequented the drinks-fuelled scenes where his alleged misdeeds with young women took place.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">According to CTV News, one misadventure began when Brown, then an MP, gave a young woman “his phone number and the names of Barrie bars that he'd be at that night, offering her help to skip any lineups, even though she was 18 at the time — below Ontario's legal drinking age.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's hard to imagine Brown thinking this would end well, though if he hadn't become a party leader, he might have just been seen as another kind of sketchy politician who preferred to date women younger, and drunker, than himself.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the last century, that was common. In the past decade, it was kind of icky. In the age of #MeToo and #TimesUp, it's a career killer.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Someday, maybe in the not-so-distant future, politicians may even recall the times when alcohol was a big part of their events — kind of like how older folks talk now about the days when drinking and driving was a common practice.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Or maybe we'll see warnings like the ones we have now for operating heavy machinery — do not commit politics after consuming more than a glass or two alcohol. (That would apply to politicians and those who deal with them, by the way.)</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The warnings could even be printed up in pamphlets — and handed out at party conventions instead of all those free drinks.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the political deserts of the mid-20th century, Canadian poet Irving Layton wrote, “A friend tells me I should not write/About the workers and their plight/For poetry like dress admits of fashion/And this is not the year for passion.” Actually, it's always time for passion in politics, but only when real.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I'm thinking of the ignoble behaviour of U.S. Democratic senate leader Chuck Schumer recently. First he shut down the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. government</span> in the name of “dreamers” — young immigrants who've never lived elsewhere but are threatened by <b>Trump</b> with deportation. Mere hours later, having done some electoral math, Schumer retreated and agreed to keep Washington humming.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">(For the record, I hate how we follow U.S. politics here, as if we were there. But that battle's over, so let's get on with dissecting their reality.)</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It was a defeat and humiliation for anti-<b>Trump</b> forces. Could it have been different? Could Schumer have persevered, giving hope to the dreamers, comforting the afflicted, while also winning political points. Yes, I'd say, but if and only if he'd been able to summon authentic moral outrage, which isn't in him.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Genuine political anger is an asset in politics but also a rarity. That may be why it's an asset: it rings true amidst falseness. It comes as a relief. Most anger sounds like it was generated by an outrage program.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Consider an exception:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the first debate of our 2015 election, the NDP's Thomas Mulcair was needling Justin <b>Trudeau</b> about the referendum margin Quebec needed to separate. What's the number, Justin? Give us a number — till <b>Trudeau</b> exploded: “You want a number? Nine! Nine!”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It shattered the calm. It was unnerving. Had he lost it? Was he barking in German? (He meant the nine Supreme Court justices.) Perhaps he'd prepped for this but waited till his eruption was unstoppable. It probably won him the election.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Compare him in Davos this week. Asked why his concern for workers should be taken seriously when all he offers is some employment insurance, he began, “Obviously, there is concern and sympathy …” I quote from memory but note the passive diction and detached tone.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yet those Davos elites are meeting in the shadow of stats showing 82 per cent of wealth generated in the world this year went to 1 per cent at the top, while the 50 per cent at the bottom got none of it. They sat like bowling pins before him, begging for it. It was the ideal moment for an angry Nein! (Not nine).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This kind of therapeutic explosion is sometimes called healthy anger. Its opposite is seething rage, which demagogues deliberately manipulate, as a means to their end. Harper stoked resentment; it seemed like the only way to electoral success for someone like him in Canada. <b>Trump</b> seethes, and unbottles it in others. They may yearn for relief, but don't find it, just more festering.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Bernie Sanders has the healthiest anger on the current political scene. He's for the dreamers, he voted against Schumer's gutless backdown. But he never loses touch with the taproot of his rage: corporate economic criminals. This week he did a TV town hall on public health care. What's the point? Schumer would say, it's not what “people” are talking about. This is not the time for your passion. Sanders doesn't care, it's who he is and what he feels. People respond to that.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Now imagine, if you can (with difficulty), Sanders in Davos. He denounces the millioneahs and billioneahs before him. How can he resist? Someone corrects him, saying Davos disdains millionaires; here we only have billionaires. He smiles that infectious grin. This is healthy anger. He knows it's funny and shares the laugh. The smile unlocks something: that we're all connected, anger notwithstanding.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Chekhov, it's said, changed drama forever with the stage direction, “She smiles through her tears.” Political passion works if you can smile winsomely through your implacable rage. It's not easy but it's worth it.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The healthiest rager I've known — to return to workers and their plight — was union leader Kent Rowley. He thundered on behalf of principled, independent Canadian unions. He mostly failed. He was the Don Quixote of Canadian labour. Knowing his end was near and still youngish — in his late 50s — he told his comrades in B.C., that after he died, to take his ashes and throw them in the faces of the Board of Trade. He didn't say it bitterly, he was smiling.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In this first month of the 12th year of democracy's global retreat, against a backdrop of shuddering and implosion in the key institutions of the liberal world order, it isn't easy to discern anything auspiciously encouraging, exactly, in the 48th annual gathering of the rich, the famous and the powerful at the <span class=\"companylink\">World Economic Forum</span> in the snowbound resort village of Davos, in Switzerland's alpine canton of Graubünden, this week.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has just wrapped up meetings in Santiago, Chile, with 31 Latin American and Caribbean countries, four regional, multilateral institutions and the <span class=\"companylink\">UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean</span>. Syrian massmurderer Bashar Assad appears to be gassing civilians again with impunity and Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan has just launched an all-out war on Syria's Kurdish resistance, sending tanks and troops across the border into Syria's Afrin enclave.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But all eyes are on Davos, where a security force of 5,000 Swiss military and police personnel has been mustered to protect 3,000 conference-goers from 90 countries, among them roughly 70 heads of state and 40 major corporate bosses. First up on the agenda: British pop legend Sir Elton John, Bollywood idol Shah Rukh Khan and Hollywood A-lister Cate Blanchett were the recipients of this year's Crystal awards, for artists who make positive impacts on society.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Davos gathering is a weeklong exercise in lavish eggheadedness with salons, workshops, speeches and panel discussions on artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, climate change, the future of work and a variety of more esoteric and highbrow concerns. The Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States gathering in Santiago, meanwhile, is a function of China's \"Belt and Road\" strategy, which aims to pull smaller countries out of the orbit of developed-world democracies and curb the influence of Europe and the United States.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Davos proceedings'opening keynote was delivered by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who didn't dwell on the findings in a report the international charity Oxfam released Monday showing that the richest one per cent of India's 1.3 billion people hoovered up 73 per cent of the total wealth generated in the country in 2017. Instead, Modi addressed himself to the virtues of globalized trade and the vices of protectionism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, a favourite of the Davos set, stuck to his usual themes: gender parity and \"progressive\" trade. He riffed off the celebrity mobilized #MeToo phenomenon that came straight out of Hollywood to shine an unwelcome spotlight on sexual harassment. \"When we receive those complaints, we must take them seriously. As women speak up, it is our responsibility to listen and, more importantly, to believe,\" <b>Trudeau</b> said. As for trade liberalization: \"We must ensure that the benefits are shared by all of our citizens and not just the few.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> used the opportunity of his speech at Davos to announce that Canada had concluded negotiations with 10 other countries in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Canadian auto-parts manufacturers, dairy farmers and labour leaders say will cost Canadians jobs and place Canadian products at a disadvantage against lowwage countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam. \"Despite a new name, there is nothing remotely progressive\" about the deal formerly known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, says Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union. \"Unifor remains opposed to this bad trade.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Meanwhile, the <span class=\"companylink\">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</span>, the White Helmets civil defence force and the local health directorate in Douma, in the country's Eastern Ghouta, reported on Monday that at least 13 people were suffering from chlorine gas suffocation following shelling by Assad regime forces. Roughly 400,000 people have been besieged by Assad's troops in Douma since 2012. At least 200 people, including 50 children, have been killed by regime bombs over the past two weeks. \"It is shameful that nearly seven years into the conflict, a war on children continues while the world watches,\" a UNICEF spokesman said on Monday.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This week, the world was watching from Davos while on Tuesday delegates from 30 countries met in Paris to endorse something called the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons. It's all about \"naming and shaming\" the individuals and entities involved in violating international covenants banning chemical weapons, Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's minister for Europe and foreign affairs, explained. Le Drian was on hand in Paris on Tuesday to unveil the partnership's website. As if a French website is going to stop Assad. Over the past two years, the <span class=\"companylink\">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) </span>has found the Syrian government guilty of using the nerve agent sarin and chlorine gas to kill civilians on several occasions since the uprising against Assad began in 2011.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Meanwhile, as the Davos festivities proceeded, Turkish tanks and troop carriers were rumbling across the Syrian border into the Kurdish enclave of Afrin. The <span class=\"companylink\">UN Security Council</span> considered the matter briefly and decided not to do anything and <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> is quiet, too, owing to embarrassment. Turkey is nominally a <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> member, but it is waging war against Kurdish guerrillas backed by the United States and several other <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> members. Turkey remains a <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> \"ally\" all the same.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On Friday, U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b> is scheduled to address the delegates at Davos. His appearance at the resort is not expected to be an uplifting event. Last week, the Gallup organization released the results of a global survey showing that world approval of the United States'international leadership had fallen to 30 per cent - four points lower than the darkest days of the administration of George W. Bush and neck and neck with China's leadership at 31 per cent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Also last week, the democracy tracking agency Freedom House released its annual report. Its main finding? For the 12th year in a row, democracy is on the run: 71 countries suffered net declines in political rights and civil liberties with only 35 countries registering gains. And Turkey is no longer a free country.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"Liberal democracies have less legitimacy than at any time since World War II, and most of their structural problems don't appear fixable,\" the global risk-analysis firm <span class=\"companylink\">Eurasia Group</span> concluded in a study released Jan. 2. \"Today's strongest leaders show little interest in civil society or common values ... if we had to pick one year for a big unexpected crisis - the geopolitical equivalent of the 2008 financial meltdown - it feels like 2018. Sorry.\"</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">U.S. tax reform has changed everything - even if the prime minister refuses to believe it. Justin <b>Trudeau</b> evidently missed the news that companies in the U.S. have been using the sudden shift to lower corporate taxes to shower bonuses and raises on workers, and plowing yet more investment into new productivity and growth. In his speech to the <span class=\"companylink\">World Economic Forum</span> in Davos Tuesday, he offered his own ill-informed approach, saying he would refuse to try competing with U.S. business tax cuts because \"People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs and their livelihoods ... (as) companies avoid taxes and boost record profits with one hand, while slashing benefits with the other.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This is no time for clapped-out anti-corporate cant. If Canada fails to respond to America's resurgent competitiveness, it's at our peril. The old rules no longer apply. Pre-2018, companies looking to invest in North America knew they had a business tax advantage in Canada, even though it suffered from having smaller market than the U.S., a weaker labour pool and colder climate. With <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, businesses operating in Canada could also count on decent access to the U.S. market, despite all the border frictions that come from dealing with two different regulatory systems.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Now, there's no certainty that <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> access is going to last, while there's absolute certainty that U.S. tax reform is real, it's here, and its impact has turned Canadian tax competitiveness upside down. Our recent lower-tax advantage has become a higher-tax handicap.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We now tax large corporate investments by about 10-per-cent more compared to the U.S. Our personal income and sales taxes are higher. And we're increasing levies on energy, which was already being taxed higher than in the U.S. Small and medium-sized business owners in the U.S. will be paying lower taxes than ours by a wide margin.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We aren't just about to lose a whole lot of business. Our governments can expect to see revenues take a long slide. Tax reform turned already competitive corporate tax rates in states like Ohio, Washington and Texas into a much better deal than what Canada offers, which will encourage companies to shift corporate profits south.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Limits in the U.S. on deducting interest costs as well as loss limitations will encourage multinationals to shift costs out of the U.S., relocating deductions to Canada. And we'll see American-owned companies start transferring money from Canada to U.S. headquarters. They'd rather use it down there to pay down debt, reinvest in the U.S., buy back shares, and - as companies from Apple to <span class=\"companylink\">Walmart</span> have already begun doing - raise wages to compete in the tight American labour market.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What should Canada's governments do? So far, they've been ignoring their new and sudden lack of competitiveness, but that's no strategy. As the Economic Advisory Council convened by Finance Minister Bill Morneau reported last year, Canada was already suffering from lacklustre investment before U.S. tax reform came along. Step One: Put a halt to planned but ill-advised tax hikes, such as Morneau's planned squeeze on small businesses operating as Canadian controlled private corporations, which will damage private equity and venture capital markets. The rich may be the ones holding most passive assets but their capital is fuel for new businesses. Instead of raising taxes on entrepreneurs - who might already be tempted to move to the U.S., the U.K., or other jurisdictions with lower personal tax rates - we should look at removing tax disadvantages, not increasing them. Step Two: Lower personal taxes by raising the threshold for tax brackets. The top rate in the United States applies at US$500,000 (for individuals) or US$600,000 (for couples). In Canada, the highest rate kicks in at a measly US$165,000. And there should be no one paying more than 50 per cent, as there is now, whether it's top earners or low-income Canadians whacked by high marginal rates from incometested benefits and personal taxes as they're trying to get ahead. Step Three: To ensure Canada remains attractive for business investments, both federal and provincial corporate income tax rates should be reduced by two points each so that Canada's corporate income tax rate at 23 per cent would be close to even low-tax U.S. states. Some of the lost revenue could be made up by dumping pointless incentives - a recent paper by John Lester at Calgary's School of Public Policy calculated that there are billions of dollars in subsidies that do more harm than good among the four biggest provinces and at the federal level.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada also has relatively weak thin-capitalization rules that make it easy for companies to dump debt into Canada. We could further tighten up on these given that the new U.S. rules discourage debt financing. Other countries like Australia have developed approaches we should consider. Step Four: If we're feeling really bold, we can shift from income-based taxes to consumption-based levies. Removing income taxes on savings would help liberate stock and bond markets. Making greater use of GST/HST is sensible as a replacement for high marginal personal tax rates. Step Five: Get the provinces into the act. Their landtransfer taxes are highly distortionary and impossible to apply properly on hard-todefine commercial property purchasers. Some provinces should look to adopt a sales tax harmonized with the GST to remove taxes on capital and intermediate purchases. Alberta can create a whole new Alberta tax advantage by slashing income taxes and replacing them instead with a provincial sales tax. (Or at least use revenues from the carbon-tax grab to lower personal taxes - or to lower corporate taxes, giving back to businesses who have lost competitiveness due to the government's imposed higher energy costs.)</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">These are all smart tax policy ideas regardless of what the rest of the world is doing. But now that the U.S. has completely flipped the competitiveness equation with its tax-reform bombshell, they sound smarter than ever.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And they're certainly a better plan than sitting on our hands and watching businesses and tax revenue drain away to Donald <b>Trump</b>'s U.S.A.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b>, leading a gerontocracy, has also had a disastrous first year. He is historically unpopular and shows no capacity to learn.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In Canada, it is a government of the young. Justin <b>Trudeau</b> is 46, and many ministers and staff are his age. His youngest minister is 30 and is pregnant. His elders - Ralph Goodale, Marc Garneau, Jim Carr - are also among the best of his ministers (even if Stéphane Dion, who was dropped, was one of the worst).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As age rules <b>Trump</b>'s America, youth rocks <b>Trudeau</b>'s Canada. Irresistibly, <b>Trudeau</b> is Minister of Youth; novelty and youth are his brand, trumpeted endlessly on social media.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">MONTREAL—Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s decision to sign on to a new Pacific trade deal that does not include the United States has reassured those who feared his government was fiddling with the trade file while <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> was on the verge of unraveling.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But the announcement[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/23/canada-10-pacific-region-nations-finalize-sweeping-trade-pact.html] that Canada will join 10 other nations in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (formerly the TPP) comes with potential downsides for the Liberals.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It stands to make holding together the fragile pro-NAFTA coalition <b>Trudeau</b> has built more difficult.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Cracks in that coalition were in evidence minutes after Tuesday's TPP announcement. Speaking for Canada's auto parts manufacturers, the president of their association, Flavio Volpe said there “could not be a dumber move at a more important time.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The president of Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union, Jerry Diaz accused the federal government of having “thrown <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> negotiators under the bus.” There was similar pushback from the steel industry.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Lobbyists for Canada's dairy farmers questioned the logic of forcing concessions on their industry that would no longer be matched by reciprocal gains in the shape of improved access to the U.S. market.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne — <b>Trudeau</b>'s main provincial ally among the larger provinces — said she was concerned about the impact of the trade deal on key sectors of her province's economy.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But in private there were questions as to whether <b>Trudeau</b>'s government concluded that, the risks of signing on to a revised TPP now were offset by the positive optics of looking like Canada was succeeding in finding alternative trade avenues.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The sixth round of tripartite <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> negotiations opened this week in Montreal in a climate of pessimism with most Canadian trade insiders bracing for the worst.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In a CTV interview last weekend former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose who sits on <b>Trudeau</b>'s NAFTA advisory council said there seemed to be a consensus that it was probably only a matter a time before the <b>Trump</b> administration pulls the plug on <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Talk of a Canadian Plan B has percolated to the surface over the past few weeks.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In any event if <b>Trudeau</b> was looking for a taste of the acrimony that may be to come if Canada — to salvage <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> — ends up making significant concessions at the negotiating table, he got it this week with the announcement of the Pacific trade deal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> talks are essentially about mitigating losses. Canada's bottom line revolves around how much it can afford to give up before it decides it is not worth pursuing the current North American trade arrangements. No amount of federal rhetoric can change the fact that the dominant thread in that narrative is one of damage control.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As an insurance policy against a <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> failure, the revised TPP offers Canada minimum coverage. It is not a remedy for the realities of geography. But it could be described as a consolation prize.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">By comparison to the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> dynamics, the Pacific trade deal stands to make at least some industry winners in Canada. The country's pork and beef producers are among those.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On the political side, <b>Trudeau</b>'s move could also give a bit of a breath of life to the flagging NDP.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The initial TPP was negotiated under Stephen Harper in the dying days of the 2015 federal election. At the time, NDP leader Tom Mulcair latched on it in an attempt to reenergize his losing campaign.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the last stretch he pivoted away from his platform to campaign hard against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The strategy is credited with having helped the NDP save some Ontario and Quebec seats.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Back then though <b>Trudeau</b> dodged the battle. The Liberals reserved judgment on the merits of the deal until after the election.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">To those who don't reside here, Canada can seem like somewhat of an enigma. In a world where intolerance and hate seem to be spreading and are endorsed by those in power, Canada has served as the Western world's city upon a hill. Seemingly immune to the forces of right-wing populism, the country boasts about its welcoming of Syrian refugees, and is led by a handsome prime minister, Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, who has openly called himself a feminist. When Donald <b>Trump</b> was elected, Americans flocked to Canada's immigration website, causing it to crash within a few hours. Lately however, some Canadians have called into question the country's image of tranquility; raising the alarm about the rising danger of Islamophobia.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The country was shocked recently when, while on her way to school, an 11-year-old girl in Toronto claimed her hijab had been slashed by a stranger. Within hours, the girl and her family were put in front of cameras to give a press conference, police had launched an investigation and politicians offered their swift condemnation. A short time later, the police abruptly closed the investigation; the girl, it appeared, had made up the story . The reaction was predictable, with many pointing to the incident as evidence that Canada does not have an Islamophobia problem.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While it may be tempting to declare claims of Islamophobia as exaggerated, the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. Almost a year ago, Alexandre Bissonnette walked into a Quebec City mosque after evening prayers and fatally shot six congregants. As the anniversary of the killings approaches, the country has found itself debating whether to hold a day of remembrance. The National Council of Canadian Muslims has proposed January 29th to serve as a \"National Day of a Remembrance and Action against Islamophobia.\" The country already holds a national day of action on violence against women each December, commemorating the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique massacre, during which 14 women were fatally shot at a university in Montreal. Political parties in Quebec have already voiced opposition to the measure, believing that a day of action against Islamophobia would unfairly portray Quebecers in a negative light.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">After the mosque massacre, the <b>Trudeau</b> government proposed M-103, a symbolic motion which called on the government to condemn Islamophobia. Far-right groups immediately pounced, and white supremacist groups such as Soldiers of Odin and La Meute rallied in cities across the country. At one of these protests in Toronto, I saw protesters holding signs warning against the \"Islamoization of Canada,\" while speakers angrily proclaimed that the proposed motion was an attempt to introduce Sharia law into the country. These protests would soon become a regular occurrence in cities across the country. By the time the motion was passed, the member of Parliament who proposed the bill, Iqra Khalid, had received hundreds of death threats .</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The National Council of Canadian Muslims listed 70 instances of Islamophobic hate crimes last year; which include graffiti being sprayed on mosques, people shouting slurs on public transit, and a bomb threat at <span class=\"companylink\">Concordia University</span> in Montreal which was meant to \"target Muslims.\" These acts are not a recent phenomenon either. According to <span class=\"companylink\">Statistics Canada</span>, hate crimes against Muslims increased by a staggering 253 percent between 2012 and 2015.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Even if the attack on the 11-year-old girl didn't happen, Muslim students have been targeted before. In the Peel Region near Toronto, protests erupted over the use of a school facility by Muslim students for Friday prayers. The students had been quietly praying in school for years without major incident. Outraged parents marched to the school board's headquarters in protest, while other protesters chose to harass Muslim students outside of local schools.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Far from being the view of a fringe minority, Islamophobia has long been aided by politicians. Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper based his 2015 reelection campaign on a platform of anti-Muslim dog whistles. His government proposed a \"barbaric cultural practices\" hotline, prevented Muslim women from wearing a niqab while taking the oath of citizenship, and claimed that 'Islamicism' was the biggest threat to Canada. Members of Harper's government went on to oppose M-103, claiming the law infringes on a Canadian's freedom of speech. Then late last year, the provincial government in Quebec introduced and passed legislation that prevented anyone wearing a face veil from accessing public services — covering everything from public transit to hospitals. These policies have had a discernible impact on the views of the population at large; in a poll conducted last year by the Angus Reid Institute, 46 percent of Canadians said they viewed Islam in an unfavorable light.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We won't know for sure why that young girl decided to fabricate this story. Children are perceptive and pick up on the atmosphere around them; the fact that she chose to make up a story about a hate crime says a lot about the present climate. Islamophobia poses a serious threat to Canadian society, and it has killed six people already. Dismissing the threat as overly dramatic hyperbole won't make it go away.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I am pleased to learn that Employment Minister Patty Hajdu is adamant.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Columnists still pompously cry, “But it's the principle.” It's not the principle they think it is. These extremist groups choose their target: the pregnant teenage girl, broke, powerless and frightened. If they talk her out of abortion, she will have to endure the hardships of pregnancy, the pain of childbirth, and ensuing poverty and desperation. This is the “principle” on which columnists make their stand: bullying.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's not a good look. I'm always astonished by the efforts newspapers will make to repel younger readers, particularly female ones. Journalism should always make readers feel they are up to speed with modern times, not drag them back to the days when sperm was considered sacred.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I find it particularly egregious when gay male columnists write this way. This is not their world. Perhaps they want to be one of the boys. For there are very few female political columnists, I note.</p>\n",

Half his cabinet is female, he works to advance the feminist cause nationally and internationally, and he backs up his words with action. He wants women employed, moving into the middle class, with daycare, able to obtain an abortion, able to escape the old ways.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Staged retro backlashes pop up again and again.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">By agreeing to a new Pacific trade deal, Canada's Liberal government has taken out what it hopes is an insurance policy against the collapse of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's decision to join 10 other nations in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership comes as negotiators huddle in Montreal in a desperate effort to keep the <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> alive.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Back in November, Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> said that he was in no hurry to make a decision on the Pacific deal. But that calculation appears to have changed as prospects for a successful <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation dim.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada did not get what it wanted in the important area of auto parts from the Pacific deal. Nor is it clear that it successfully exempted its cultural industries from the new deal's free-trade rules.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yet at a meeting Tuesday in Tokyo, Ottawa agreed to join anyway. The new pact, which includes Japan, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Chile, Brunei and Peru, comprises only 14 per cent of world trade.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But for fans of free-trade deals - including most of Canada's big business class - it is better than nothing.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And nothing is what Canada might get from the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> talks. American President Donald <b>Trump</b> has repeatedly said he will pull the U.S. out of the three-nation pact unless Canada and Mexico meet all his demands.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada and Mexico have responded by saying that some of those demands, particularly one that would eliminate the right of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> signatories to challenge one another's trade practices before an independent panel, are deal breakers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yet Ottawa has also signalled a new willingness to bargain other <b>Trump</b> demands that it had once dismissed out of hand, such as his insistence on eliminating <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>'s investor-state dispute settlement system. This allows foreign companies to challenge domestic laws before special trade panels.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">How will Canada's decision to buy into the Pacific pact affect the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> talks?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, it will irritate the Americans. One of <b>Trump</b>'s first actions as president was to pull the U.S. out of this pact's predecessor, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He will not be amused that his good buddy <b>Trudeau</b> is going ahead with a truncated version of that Pacific deal before <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> is resolved.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Second, it may make some of the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> issues more difficult. Under the Pacific deal, autos and auto parts may be traded among member nations duty-free as long as 35 to 45 per cent of their content is manufactured within the bloc.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Under <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, the rules of origin are far stricter, demanding 62.5 per cent North American content. Yet even then <b>Trump</b> thinks they are too loose.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's not clear how he would respond to a situation in which Canadian auto manufacturers were following two rules-of-origin regimes, with the possibility of cross-over between them.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Third, Ottawa's decision to join the Pacific pact puts paid to the already remote possibility that Canada and the U.S. might come to an agreement without Mexico.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Mexico is part of the new Pacific deal. If <b>Trump</b> doesn't want direct free trade with Mexico, he's unlikely to accept indirect free trade with it via Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the end, Ottawa didn't get what it wanted in the new and revamped Pacific pact. It is signing side deals with Japan, Australia and Malaysia on autos. But it appears to have acceded to Japan's insistence that weak rules of origin for auto parts remain in place.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It did not win an exemption for Canadian cultural industries within the deal itself. But it will sign so-called side letters on cultural matters with the other 10 nations when the deal is inked.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's not yet known what will be in those letters.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And while promoting the deal as \"progressive\" (Canada insisted that the pact's name be changed to reflect this), Ottawa has raised little objection to Vietnam's request that it be given more time to improve labour rights.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Politically, however, all of this is secondary. With <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> on the ropes, the <b>Trudeau</b> government needs to show that it can still pull off free-trade deals.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Ronald Reagan was a stripling of 69 when he took office in 1981. <b>Trump</b> represents the opposite of a youth movement: his presidency is a senior moment. In 2018, age defines America's political class, but it does not mean wisdom, experience or prudence.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Democratic leadership in Congress is old: House minority leader Nancy Pelosi is 77 and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is 67. Neither has presidential ambitions, but they want to run Congress, which is why Pelosi is running in November's mid-term elections. She wants to be Speaker again.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senator majority leader, will be 76 in February.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> is comfortable with his contemporaries. John Kelly, his chief of staff, is 67. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is 71. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is 80. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is 65.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b>'s cabinet of plutocrats is said to be the wealthiest ever named. With an average age of 62, these are the golden agers of the new Gilded Age.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Of course, age is no guarantee of anything. Nor is youth. John F. Kennedy was the youngest elected president in history, an avatar of generational change.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Kennedy had a disastrous first year but became a successful, beloved president. He was fresh and innovative, with a capacity to learn.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b>, leading a gerontocracy, has also had a disastrous first year. He is historically unpopular and shows no capacity to learn.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In Canada, it is a government of the young. Justin <b>Trudeau</b> is 46, and many ministers and staff are his age. His youngest minister is 30 and is pregnant. His elders - Ralph Goodale, Marc Garneau and Jim Carr - are also among the best of his ministers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As age rules <b>Trump</b>'s America, youth rocks <b>Trudeau</b>'s Canada. Irresistibly, <b>Trudeau</b> is Minister of Youth. Novelty and youth are his brand, trumpeted endlessly on social media. A variation on his father's dictum in 1968, he wants \"new guys (and gals) with new ideas.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The rap against his government is that it's ageist. Partisans and authorities over 50 seem unwelcome. A youthful minister told me: \"I just wish the baby boomers would get out of the way.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The problem is they aren't, at least not demographically. Canada's median age is 40, but the number of those over 65 is sharply increasing. These people outnumber Canadians under 14 for the first time, and seniors are more likely to vote than are younger people.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Still, youth defines this government. Young ministers are free to make mistakes, and they do. Often it's because no one of political experience and institutional memory - read age - is there to step in.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b>'s America and <b>Trudeau</b>'s Canada turn conventional wisdom on its head. <b>Trump</b>'s sexagenarians and septuagenarians aren't always prudent or cautious; <b>Trudeau</b>'s young titans are not always daring or innovative.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If the talks do sour, it won't be that much of a surprise. Donald <b>Trump</b> campaigned on tearing up the trade agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico. He claimed it was the \"worst deal ever,\" even if he did give us the runaround by later promising to only \"tweak\" the deal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There's another reason why it could all fall apart, though. And this one would be of our own making. That would be our insistence on inserting \"progressive\" provisions into the deal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the lead-up to the official talks, the Liberal government was conducting their preliminary talks in a manner above reproach. They got in from the ground floor to woo American politicians and businesses to the importance of trade with Canada. All seemed smooth.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Then in August, just before round one began, things got odd, quickly.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In a video released by Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Canada listed \"make it more progressive\" as a top priority. Freeland called to \"protect the environment,\" \"commit to gender equality\" and \"improve relations with Indigenous people.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The response from trade experts and observers was basically a big \"huh?\" These requests continue to make little sense. Even if you support these issues, they are just not the key planks of trade deals. Trade provisions are what matters in trade deals.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Besides, even if the U.S. agrees with us on these matters, they're going to enshrine them on their own terms, not ours.</p>\n",

For human progress, this is fantastic. Billions will be lifted out of poverty. Central to this progress is access to reliable and reasonably priced power.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">According to every reliable forecasting agency, from the <span class=\"companylink\">International Energy Agency</span> to multinational energy conglomerates like <span class=\"companylink\">BP</span>, the rising demand for energy cannot be met any time soon by renewables like wind and solar.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For some, rising energy-fuelled growth and prosperity is more of a curse than a blessing. How can we \"decarbonize\" our world in the face of inexorable growth in demand for oil, coal and natural gas? As the world's fastest-growing economies expand fossil fuels usage, Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> is heading in the opposite direction, heaping on taxes and regulations designed to reduce consumption of carbon-based energy along with the emissions and jobs it produces.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The tax-and-regulatory gap with Canada's largest trading partner widened after Donald <b>Trump</b> became president of the United States. When <b>Trump</b> jettisoned the Paris climate agreement he was loudly rebuked. Consumer products giant <span class=\"companylink\">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> was among those calling for climate action.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When <b>Trudeau</b> came face-to-face with 54-year-old Kathy Katula from rural Ontario last January, he learned about real-life consequences.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"My heat and hydro now cost me more than my mortgage,\" Katula tearfully explained.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"How is it justified for you to ask me to pay a carbon tax when I only have $65 left of my paycheque every two weeks to feed my family?\" Although <b>Trudeau</b>'s carbon tax will make hydrocarbon fuels even more expensive, Katula's main complaint is with the Liberal government of Ontario.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ontarians suffering from energy poverty can blame the province's massively subsidized and poorly structured green energy contracts, recklessly rapid phase-out of coal power, the infamous gas plant cancellations and gross mismanagement of power supply and demand.</p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <b>Trudeau</b> government has chalked up a strategic win by signing on to a new, avowedly more progressive Pacific trade deal. Whether it's a victory in substance as well is far less clear.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Strategically, joining 10 other Pacific countries in a comprehensive economic arrangement[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/23/canada-trans-pacific-trade-members-agree-to-revised-deal-without-the-us-reports-suggest.html] comes at a particularly auspicious moment for the government. It reminds Washington that Canada has other options on trade — a useful message as the latest round of contentious negotiations with the United States and Mexico on North American trade get underway this week in Montreal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada doesn't have a tremendous amount of leverage in these talks. So it helps to show we're doing all we can to open other markets in case the U.S. actually pulls the plug on the <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>, as President Donald <b>Trump</b> keeps threatening to do.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It also gave Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> a chance to drive home his government's message that, in a world of increasing protectionism, the only trade deals worth reaching are ones that make sure economic benefits are spread widely. “We have to put the concerns of ordinary citizens at the centre of our negotiations,” he told an audience at the elite <span class=\"companylink\">World Economic Forum</span> in Davos — a gathering where “ordinary citizens” are extremely thin on the ground.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This is a fine message, if it's carried out in reality, not just rhetoric. Inserting the word “progressive” into the name of the updated Pacific trade deal (which Canada pushed for) certainly doesn't make it so.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Hence the question marks over the substance of the updated agreement. Canada walked away from the negotiating table in November, saying the deal fell short for this country in some key areas.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The government endured a fair amount of criticism at the time for disrupting the negotiations among the “TPP11” group. But now <b>Trudeau</b> and his international trade minister, François-Philippe Champagne, say they have made “real gains” that make the deal worth signing.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That's hard to judge, given the few details made public so far.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">According to the government, parts of the agreement dealing with such matters as labour rights and environmental issues have been strengthened. And, it says, Canada has won assurances on some issues of specific interest to this country.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On culture, it appears, Canada has won an exemption sheltering our industries from competition. It has also won concessions on intellectual property, where the original agreement would have had the effect of raising pharmaceutical prices and extending copyright protections beyond current international norms.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Those provisions will now reportedly be suspended, an outcome digital expert Michael Geist hails as proof[http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2018/01/canada-successfully-stands-balanced-ip-canadian-culture-tpp-deal/] that “caving in to foreign pressures is not a viable strategy.” That's encouraging.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The biggest winners are likely Canadian agricultural producers — specifically Western beef and grain producers who will get much more access to the lucrative Japanese market. They're delighted with the deal. Others, such as dairy farmers, worry that their lock on the Canadian market will be further eroded. Such are the trade-offs involved in any comprehensive deal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The biggest fight will surely be in the auto sector, where the Big Three North American manufacturers and auto parts makers are already protesting lower quotas for North American content. They fear Japanese auto companies will be able to use cheaper Asian-made parts and get a competitive edge. In other words, Canadian auto workers will have to compete more with low-wage foreign labour.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What's missing in all of this are the details that will show whether the exemptions and new provisions Canada has won can be truly effective, or are mostly for show.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Until they are known, it won't be possible to make a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and know whether Canada is likely to come out as a winner overall, or a loser — and who will come out on the short end of the deal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the short run, though, the winner is a government whose biggest priority must still be protecting Canada's interests in <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. For this country, that's still the great game in trade.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The prime minister is off to Davos, where we are told he will \"champion Canada as an attractive place to invest.\" That's nice to hear, and certainly one wouldn't want him to suggest he had any doubts on that score. But, er, is it?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The question might strike many Canadians as strange. Isn't our economy the envy of the western world, growing at a solid (if unspectacular) 3 per cent over the last four quarters? Hasn't unemployment fallen to its lowest level in 40 years?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But those numbers describe where we've been, not where we're going. To be sure, rebounding oil prices have helped the economy snap back from its middecade doldrums. (Though let's not overstate this. Fun fact: the economy has grown more slowly, on average, over the last two years - roughly 2.2 per cent annually - than over the previous six.) And exports, spurred by a broad-based expansion in the world economy, should help prolong growth in the short term.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But the longer-term outlook is decidedly less rosy - the Finance department projects growth in future decades at just 1.7 per cent per year - and even in the short term the barriers to investment, notwithstanding the prime minister's optimism, are accumulating.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">You can only boast about how well our banking sector survived the financial crisis so many times.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As it is, business investment has been a chronic weak point for Canada for years. Though it rebounded somewhat in 2017, it remains well below its 2014 peak, in real terms. At roughly 11 per cent of GDP, it ranks 16th out of 17 <span class=\"companylink\">OECD</span> countries surveyed in a recent study by former Statistics Canada chief economist Philip Cross, and has flatlined for most of the last two decades.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Worse, investment in machinery and equipment - the kind that leads to increases in productivity - has fallen, from over 6 per cent of GDP in 2000 to just 4 per cent. Want to know why productivity lags in Canada? Business investment per worker in Canada, at roughly $9,300 (in 2010 US dollars), is 40 to 50 per cent less than it is in high-productivity countries like Switzerland, Norway and the United States.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The prime minister can bend famous ears in Davos, but what do investors, foreign or domestic, see when they look at Canada? They see, first of all, a foreign trade situation that is rapidly deteriorating: not only <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, where negotiations, after months of mutual antagonism, are in serious jeopardy of collapse, but the bungling of the Trans Pacific Partnership and China initiatives, with collateral damage to relations with Japan.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Not long ago, a business could locate in Canada with reasonable prospects of barrier-free access to most of the major markets of the world. Now, even the American border looks more and more like a wall: an investor today will think twice before putting a plant on this side. Much of the blame for that, certainly, can be attached to the <b>Trump</b> administration, but what are we doing to compensate on other fronts?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What, say, of taxes? Much attention has focused on the sharp reduction in business taxes arising from the recent U.S. tax reform: a marginal effective tax rate on capital investment, federal and state combined, of less than 19 per cent, according to calculations by University of Calgary economist Jack Mintz, down from 34.6 per cent. Rather less attention has been paid to the steady rise in the same taxes in Canada, from 17.5 per cent in 2012 to 21 per cent today.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">An investor looking at Canada must also reckon with a marginal rate of personal income tax exceeding 50 per cent in much of the country, not only on his own income but those of his top employees. And that's not including pending increases in Canada Pension Plan levies: not technically taxes, though employers and employees could be forgiven for thinking of them as such, especially when they look at how the CPP investment fund spends their money.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What of government deficits and debt? We've grown used to thinking of the federal debt as being under control, but provincial debts have been exploding. At 30 per cent of GDP, net provincial debt is up from 20 per cent a decade ago - this, even before the costs of an aging population have really begun to bite.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And while the fall economic statement showed federal deficits steadily declining over the next few years, a new study by <span class=\"companylink\">the Institute of Fiscal Studies</span> and Democracy shows them steadily increasing, from $20 billion last year to $32 billion four years from now. The difference? Finance numbers depend upon direct program expenses, which have been growing at 7 per cent annually, suddenly and permanently slowing to a little over 1 per cent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Add to this the escalating cost of carbon taxes, imposed not as a replacement for existing subsidy and regulatory programs but on top of them; sudden and massive minimum wage hikes in several provinces; skyrocketing electricity prices in Ontario, temporarily suppressed at the cost of still higher prices to come; the increasing impossibility of building pipelines anywhere; and an interprovincial \"free trade\" agreement that included 167 pages of exceptions.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">You can load a great deal onto an economy's back in good times, but when the bad times come, as they inevitably will - we have not had a recession in nine years, or a serious one in 25 - the bill for all this fecklessness will be horrendous.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Perhaps the executives in attendance at Davos will be reassured by the prime minister's talk. But I imagine once they get back to their offices and have a fuller briefing, they may say to themselves: are these people serious?</p>\n",

       " Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s government has changed the requirements for organizations seeking grants from the Canada Summer Jobs program, which creates temporary employment for young people. In order to access funding, groups now must agree to respect women's reproductive rights, including the right to abortion (spelled out in the guidance document with the application).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Faith groups that oppose abortions say they can't meet this requirement. This, in turn, means some religious institutions won't be hiring many young people this year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Opposing abortion isn't illegal, and most of those who hold anti-abortion views sincerely seek a better world. Like capital punishment, abortion is an issue about which intelligent people are deeply divided. Political parties may have their own membership rules - the federal Liberals, for instance, require their candidates to support choice - but when governments dole out public money, they have no moral right to shut out taxpayers or organizations that don't endorse their values.</p>\n",

If the <b>Trudeau</b> government has overstepped, isn't it only a minor transgression? No. <b>Trump</b>, in his bumptious fashion, at least acknowledges overtly that there are differing views; he wants his side to win.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There was a collective sigh of relief across the country last May after Kellie Leitch was eliminated from the federal Conservative leadership race. Leitch, who had served in cabinet during former prime minister Stephen Harper's final years in office, became infamous during the campaign for her signature promise to screen all incoming immigrants to ensure they held \"Canadian values.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The policy was the subject of widespread criticism, and rightfully so. Borrowing heavily from a certain American president's playbook, Leitch did little to substantively define the values she claimed were essential to our national identity. In the end, the content of these values was never really the point. Only the most ardent of Leitch's supporters would deny that her appeal to values was little more than a front to keep specific types of immigrants (mainly Muslims) out of Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It would be dangerous, however, to assume that just because Leitch was so resolutely rejected by her own party, others will not similarly attempt to rely on ill-defined values to restrict the rights of minority groups, especially religious ones. If recent trends tell us anything, it's that such efforts will come not just from would-be Donald <b>Trump</b> imitators but also from those who - apparently - hail from the progressive end of the political spectrum.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The principles championed by these political leaders are not of the nativist variety favoured by Leitch. Instead, the values that they promote are woven within the fabric of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - or so they claim. Yet increasingly, these very charter values are being used as a pretext to override the unpopular exercise of charter rights.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Consider the recent changes made by Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s government to the Canada Summer Jobs program, which sponsors small businesses, charities and not-for-profits who hire young people as summer employees. Although last year the prime minister expanded the size of the program to sponsor almost 70,000 positions, a new policy will exclude numerous religious organizations from receiving the grant.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Under the revised policy, all organizations applying for Canada Summer Jobs funding must attest that their \"core mandate (respects) individual human rights in Canada, including the values underlying the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\" On its face, such a requirement seems unlikely to create any serious barriers for religious groups. Yet in the same policy, the government defines charter values as encompassing (among other things) \"reproductive rights\" and \"the right to access safe and legal abortions.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <b>Trudeau</b> government maintains that the new policy was not intended to specifically target religious minorities. At best, however, this insistence comes across as insincere. Many religious groups that sincerely hold a pro-life world view (including conservative Muslim, evangelical Christian and Orthodox Jewish denominations) will be unable to accede to the specificity of the government's mantra. By not offering any exemptions for these groups - as most human rights legislation similarly does - the new requirement downplays the equally important charter values of religious freedom and religious equality.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Indeed, one of the most important elements of religious freedom is the principle of state neutrality. As an ideal, this important constitutional principle precludes governments from favouring (or, in this case, disfavouring) any religion or belief over another.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The new Canada Summer Jobs eligibility requirement flies directly in the face of this duty. Instead of effectively barring pro-life religious groups from receiving the grant, the <b>Trudeau</b> government should revise the policy so that it respects all charter values, including those that protect the rights of religious minorities.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In a culture as diverse as ours, there will always be situations where the views of minority religious groups clash with those of the state. But as one Nova Scotia judge wrote in 2015 ruling, \"That is a messy and uncomfortable fact of life in a pluralistic society.\" Veiled discriminatory appeals to values (charter or otherwise) have no place in an inclusive society that seeks to accommodate religious and cultural minorities Kristopher Kissinger is a J.D. candidate at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto and a contributor to the legal blog TheCourt.ca. twitter.com/kkinsinger</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer did not receive a lot of media attention at home or abroad on the occasion of his maiden visit to Washington this week but he got the kind of coverage he and his party need more of over the next year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The message Scheer took to Washington was that at the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> negotiating table Canada speaks with one voice and he stuck to it even when that meant declining to answer questions that could have led him on a path more critical of Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s government.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A debriefing news conference initially scheduled for Friday in Ottawa was cancelled due to illness. Inasmuch as it allowed Scheer to avoid an occasion to be taken off a constructive message track, the cancellation may have been a blessing in disguise.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">With the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> talks between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico about to resume in Montreal, discretion on the part of the official Opposition is the better part of valour.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Here are some reasons why:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">* A year in Donald <b>Trump</b>'s presidency, the White House's <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> end game remains uncertain. As has been his fashion since his swearing-in, the president had managed over the course of the first weeks of what could be a make-or-break year for the tripartite trade arrangement to send contrary signals as to its future.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For obvious reasons Canadians are, so far, inclined to pin the blame for a potential failure at the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> negotiating table on <b>Trump</b> rather than on <b>Trudeau</b>. The last thing Scheer needs in this context is to be seen as part of the problem and not of the solution.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">* <b>Trudeau</b>'s <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> tent is peopled with Conservative insiders. Those include Scheer's interim predecessor, Rona Ambrose, as well as former Industry minister James Moore. By virtue of their past experience in senior cabinet portfolios, both bring more gravitas to the debate than the rookie Conservative leader. Scheer has no interest in isolating himself from some of the more credible figures associated with his party's recent past in government.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">* The talks — if they do not abort — will likely come down to how much water Canada is willing to put in its wine to salvage <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. Should that point ever be reached, walking back the Liberal talk on the need for a more “progressive” trade arrangement could be the least of the prime minister's problems.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> could be forced to make hard choices between competing Canadian interests. The arbitration could pit region against region. On this, as on the option of walking away from a mediocre deal, Scheer would have reasons to not rush to play back seat driver.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Take the dismantling of Canada's supply management system. It is high on the U.S. wish list and there is no lack of Canadian critics of the protection the country affords its dairy and poultry industries. But Scheer is not one of them. The pro-supply management lobby, in particular in Quebec, was instrumental in ensuring his upset leadership victory last year. The Conservative leader is in no position to prod <b>Trudeau</b> down the path of giving in to American demands on that front.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the larger picture, the best-case scenario for the Conservatives would be to ensure <b>Trudeau</b> wears any concession Canada eventually makes at the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> table.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That is not to say the Canada/U.S. file does not provide Scheer and his party with some openings to score some lasting political points for themselves.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It offers them an opportunity to put some much-needed distance between the hyperpartisan tone consistently cultivated by the Conservatives under Stephen Harper and Scheer's watch. That cause was not advanced over his first full sitting as leader in the House of Commons.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The fall session of <span class=\"companylink\">Parliament</span> saw Conservative finance critique Pierre Poilievre step into the shoes of chief prosecutor of the government that Thomas Mulcair used to fill. And in that role, Poilievre was no less effective than the former NDP leader.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But it is possible to pay tribute to Poilievre's undeniable talents as an attack dog but to also note that those are not necessarily the credentials most Canadians crave for in a federal finance minister.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If Scheer is going to have a shot at replacing <b>Trudeau</b> as prime minister it will be because he will have convinced enough voters that he leads a competent, politically mature government-in-waiting.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On that score, the rookie Conservative leader has so far been better served by the nuanced approach of foreign affairs critic Erin O'Toole to the Canada/U.S. brief than by any amount of question period antics.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On his official itinerary[https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2018/01/13/itinerary-saturday-january-13-2018] for last weekend, Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> was said to be having “personal” time in Ottawa.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Social media, however, told a slightly different story. In photos circulating on <span class=\"companylink\">Facebook</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">Instagram</span>, <b>Trudeau</b> is shown spending part of last Saturday at a Liberal Party of Canada national executive meeting.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It looks like a quick, drop-in affair — the prime minister, clad in a black quilted jacket, is seated around a large conference table, talking to his loyal troops. So, does this really qualify as “personal” time?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Stephen Harper used to do these stealth-type visits as well when Conservatives were meeting in Ottawa, presumably also to ensure that the media wasn't there to see the former prime minister fraternizing with partisans.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What's with all the secrecy? Somehow, we seem to have decided that leaders' partisan activities fall outside the otherwise wide-open boundaries of being a public person in the digital age.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Well, to a point. What was odd about <b>Trudeau</b>'s sort-of-private meeting is that it came on the same weekend as a press release from his own Liberal party — taunting other leaders for being less open about partisan events.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Liberals pointed out — accurately — that they now regularly alert the media about fundraising events that <b>Trudeau</b> is attending, while the opposition parties do not.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“Both the Conservatives and NDP have continued to organize their fundraising events in secret — keeping journalists out and hiding details from Canadians about who is attending their closed-door events,” Azam Ishmael, the Liberals' national director, is quoted as saying in the news release.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“Canadians expect our political leaders to meet the highest standards for openness and transparency. The start of their first full year as party leaders is a great time for (Conservative Leader) Andrew Scheer and (NDP Leader) Jagmeet Singh to do the right thing and bring their secret fundraising events out into the open.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Singh, for his part, was practising openness on a whole new level about his personal life this past week, taking the media with him to the restaurant where he presented a ring and marriage proposal[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/16/federal-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-pops-the-question-and-gurkiran-kaur-says-yes.html] to Gurkiran Kaur Sidhu.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It took place at a vegetarian restaurant in Toronto where the couple reportedly had their first date. Here's how The <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Press</span> described the magical moment.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“Along with friends and family, Singh invited several members of the media, including The <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Press</span>, to witness the surprise proposal Tuesday night. Friends cheered as Singh and Sidhu arrived. Singh pulled a ring out of his jacket pocket and got down on one knee to propose to Sidhu, who accepted.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So, to recap, no openness from the NDP about fundraisers, or so the Liberals allege, but open access to the leader's marriage proposals. The NDP isn't alone in making the personal political — Conservatives and Liberals have often used a leader's life events — Mother's Day or the birth of a child, in <b>Trudeau</b>'s case — to gather up digital contact[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/03/04/conservatives_liberals_ndp_look_to_mine_online_sources.html] information from Canadians.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We're at a strange juncture surrounding this whole business of what's public and what's private in Canadian politics. We don't have our leaders releasing details of their medical checkups, as Donald <b>Trump</b> did[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/01/17/a-70-plus-year-old-man-who-is-obese-and-doesnt-exercise-outside-cardiologists-say-trumps-physical-reveals-serious-heart-concerns.html] this week (some say fictitiously). Nor does the media seem inclined to intrude on the prime minister's time if it's deemed to be “personal.” (Unless it's a Christmas vacation on the Aga Khan's island.)</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The standards and rules are clearly in flux, based entirely on the whim of the moment. We aren't yet entirely clear on whether political parties are public or private entities — not just when it comes to our own curiosity, but also in the eyes of the law.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Several years ago, the man who is now the prime minister's principal adviser, Gerald Butts, said he was leaning toward the idea that parties should be totally public[https://ipolitics.ca/2016/03/15/how-the-parties-collect-your-personal-info-and-why-trudeau-doesnt-seem-to-mind/].</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">At a digital governance conference in early 2015, Butts told the audience: “Let's not kid ourselves, political parties are public institutions of a sort. They are granted within national or sub-national legislation special status on a whole variety of fronts, whether they be the charitable deduction, the exemption from access to information — all those sorts of things.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Back then, Butts wasn't sure it was a good thing for political parties to try to be simultaneously public and private. “I think that is increasingly a problem and it is difficult for me to envision a future where it exists for much longer,” he said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Three years since those words were uttered, that private-public distinction seems even more murky — especially after a week in which an engagement party was wide open to the public while a party board meeting was declared to be “personal” time for the prime minister. “Party” is obviously a flexible concept when it comes to political transparency in Canada right now.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Our series, \"Politics for the rest of us,\" formally wraps up today as writer Brigitte Pellerin draws some optimistic conclusions from her interviews over the last month with 10 disparate Canadians willing to discuss their politics without resorting to namecalling or internet insults: What started out as an idea is ending with a heartening revelation: I was right to believe that all those people shouting on social media were not representative of the rest of us.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We talk a lot about the fragmentation of our political discourse and the harsh, brittle and angry tone omnipresent on the internet. It's an environment that discourages all but the most partisan from engaging in online political discussions. But there's something else out there: a core of decent people with opinions and values and excellent critical skills who'd rather opt out of shrill online conversations.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I had myself left the online fray a few years back and was happier for it. But when Donald <b>Trump</b> and the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., happened, I could no longer stay silent. I'd been associated with the right wing for so long and I didn't want anyone to think I was still in that camp if that camp meant <b>Trump</b>. My departure earned me many an unflattering epithet.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"We always knew you were a Liberal, you asinine <b>Trudeau</b> lover,\" was the gist of it, albeit more crudely expressed in the internet universe.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That's when the idea hit me: What if I could help bring people closer together to discuss their politics instead of watching social media push them farther apart? What if I could highlight how nuanced their opinions are? I'm not the first one to think it would be nice if we could be civil to one another. For instance, a lady from Almonte wrote to tell me about her Friends of Mississippi Mills group on <span class=\"companylink\">Facebook</span> that aims to discuss local issues without negativity. A few media personalities have also done special shows on the subject, such as Steve Paikin on The Agenda or Andrew Coyne and Paula Simons debating civility on <span class=\"companylink\">CBC Radio</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Samara Canada has an interesting project, Cheering or Jeering, where MPs open up about civility in their workplace (where it is sorely needed). And <span class=\"companylink\">Democracy Watch</span>'s Honesty in Politics campaign also contributes, albeit indirectly, to the solution.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A few academics are also studying the topic, including University of Lethbridge's John von Heyking's intriguing Friendship and Politics project.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Since mid-December, I've been interviewing people about their politics. They've all had the opportunity to describe themselves and their opinions - and sometimes concede maybe there's room for debate.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This wasn't scientific: I found most of my interviewees by putting out online calls for volunteers, whom I grouped roughly by labels (yes, I know. Bear with me). I wanted my sample to be reasonably well-balanced ideologically, geographically, demographically, culturally. Where I felt I was missing representation, I reached out to both personal acquaintances and the interviewees themselves for recommendations. This imperfect methodology meant there were gaps, but I hoped readers of the series would identify with at least one of my interviewees.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Here are some things these people have shown me:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Most people's positions are not black and white, even on touchstone moral issues. For instance, those who were pro-choice were also quick to agree abortion was more problematic in the late stages of pregnancy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Most, including fervent small-government advocates, were in favour of a universal health-care system; nobody wanted to go back to a time when a serious illness almost automatically meant bankruptcy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Most favour an economic system in which it is not overly complicated to run a business and create jobs.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">None, regardless of their spot on the political spectrum, liked the idea that universities should shut down unpopular ideas and speakers. Everybody was keen on having debates, even over obnoxious views. Everyone seemed to agree restricting speech leads to more bigotry because it renders people incapable of arguing against ideas they don't like.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Alongside that, people were respectful of their fellows'freedom of conscience, religion or speech.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Just about everybody was disappointed by politicians and felt ill-served by them.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Everyone was in favour of engaging in more in-depth discussions.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That last point surprised me the most, but in a pleasant way. These people wanted us all to talk more. Face to face, in long conversations, with those whose opinions differ from ours.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The exercise helped restore my faith in the inherent goodness of most people. As a rule, the comments I received directly were overwhelmingly positive. Readers liked the idea of hearing from normal people and agreed it was a good idea to do something about the tone of our public discourse.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Feedback wasn't always this cordial. Some online commenters on the Citizen's website seemed to miss the point of the exercise, choosing to insult interviewees'opinions or question their motives.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Perhaps this shows what my interviewees have been saying: We need more inperson debates and fewer social-media slugfests.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I'm going to continue this experiment for a little while longer. From time to time, I'll ask my panel for their opinions on specific news stories and see where they agree and disagree and why.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A lot of professional pundits share their own takes on any given topic; it would be nice for a change to have our new-found mini focus group of regular people - with real lives and real jobs outside of politics - tell us what they think, too.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In 1854, the Canadian colonies entered a free-trade agreement with the United States. In 1866, the Americans cancelled it, believing that the Canadian colonies had become so dependent on the U.S. economically that they would ask or beg for entry into the American Union.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead, the Canadians decided to take the bold step of independence.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">They negotiated a union of the Canadian colonies and began building a Canadian-owned and controlled economy, including the world's longest railway.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's next major free-trade agreement with the U.S. was in 1988 (FTA), later expanded to include Mexico in 1994 (<span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>). Under their terms, much of Canada's economy has been bought up by American owners - everything from <span class=\"companylink\">Hudson's Bay Company</span> to <span class=\"companylink\">Tim Hortons</span> and Stelco. Whole industries have been taken over by U.S. investors, including both our national railways. U.S. corporations have the right to sue Canada for any law or regulation that causes them loss or damage and which they feel contravenes the spirit of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. (Canada has been sued three dozen times and paid out more than $200 million in <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> penalties.)</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">However, the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. government</span> may again save us from ourselves.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The U.S. is demanding even greater concessions from Canada in a \"renegotiation\" of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, including sweeping rights to buy up what is left of Canada's economy. It has stated that it is ready to trigger the six-month cancellation clause of <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. In response, the <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian government</span> has spent millions trying to convince it not to do so.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As in 1866, Canada has a choice: to integrate itself even further into the U.S. economy, giving up the dream of Canadian independence, or it can do what it did in 1866 and step forward to build a Canadian-owned, worldclass economy. It can stop pleading with the U.S. to keep <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> and emerge as a significant competitor to our neighbour, not its colony.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Before Canada signed the FTA and <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, it traded with the U.S. and the rest of the world under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), now the <span class=\"companylink\">World Trade Organization (WTO)</span>. If the FTA and <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> were terminated, Canada would automatically return to trading with the U.S. under the <span class=\"companylink\">WTO</span>, under whose terms we did much better than under the FTA and <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Under the GATT/WTO, Canada had allies and the U.S. was unable to impose punishing tariffs on our softwood lumber exports or our aircraft industry. It was unable to destroy our wheat marketing system, buy up our railways or shut down our steel industry.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Norway, much smaller than Canada, declined to enter the <span class=\"companylink\">European Union</span>, although it was under great pressure to do so. It retained control of its oil and gas and other industries through publicly owned corporations. The result for Norway is no debt, no deficit, free child care and university education, virtually non-existent homelessness, free dental care for all under 18, generous old age pensions and a $1-trillion surplus in its sover-eign wealth fund.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada by contrast, after almost three decades of \"free trade\" with the U.S., has more than $1.2 trillion in federal and provincial debt, large deficits at every level, no national child or dental care, high university tuition, miserly old age pensions, years of massive budget cuts and giveaway prices for its exports of oil, gas, timber and minerals.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For 150 years, great Canadian leaders have warned that without an economic border with the United States, we would soon no longer have a political border.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We once owned the world's largest farm machinery maker in Massey Harris, headquartered in Toronto; built the world's largest and most respected marketer of wheat and barley in the <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Wheat Board</span>, based in Winnipeg; created a great transcontinental railway system beginning in Montreal, which tied our country together; and saw Vancouver's shipyards produce the beautiful Fast Cat ferry.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead of spending hundreds of billions on foreign-made machinery, electronics, automobiles, ships, fighter jets and passenger aircraft (even payroll systems for federal employees!), we can build our own, both for the domestic and export market.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We once designed and built the world's most advanced jet interceptor, the Avro Arrow, so we know it can be done. With Canada's resources and ingenuity, it could create a prosperous, domestically controlled economy that would give Canadians multiple benefits, security and pride of ownership. All that is required is some of the will that drove our ancestors to create an alternate power in North America.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There's a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality when it comes to the <b>Trudeau</b> government and Canada's record on international aid.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The words are admirable. The prime minister has proudly told the world that, under his government, “Canada is back” as an active player on the international stage.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yet the numbers show this country is at the back of the pack among global peers[https://www.opencanada.org/features/paying-its-global-share-canadas-not-backits-far-back/] in matching promises with dollars. In fact, its commitment to international assistance is at near-record lows and it's tied for last place with Japan in the share of national income going to aid.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <b>Trudeau</b> government inherited a bad situation from the Conservatives, who slashed spending on aid to balance the federal budget in time for the 2015 election. But in the past two years the Liberals have done nothing to fix the situation; if anything, it's gotten worse.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The 2018 federal budget will be an opportunity to change course. At the very least, the government should halt the drift downward and start rebuilding Canada's commitment to international aid.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The time is right. Canada holds the presidency of the <span class=\"companylink\">G7</span> this year and Justin <b>Trudeau</b> will host the group's annual summit in the Charlevoix region of Quebec this June, where he plans to emphasize gender equality and climate change. And the government is campaigning for a seat on the <span class=\"companylink\">UN Security Council</span>. If Canada wants to be taken seriously as an international player, it must back its words with dollars.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">At the same time, reversing the trend on foreign aid would send a powerful signal at a time when the <b>Trump</b> administration is pulling the United States away from its international commitments. That leaves an opening for Canada and other countries that reject the American retreat into surly isolationism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The situation now is shocking for anyone who values Canada's traditional role as a force for good on the world stage.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada spends about $5 billion a year on international aid, which sounds like a substantial amount of money. In fact, it amounts to just 0.26 per cent of GDP (or 26 cents out of every $100 of national income), according to the <span class=\"companylink\">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That's substantially less than the generally accepted average of comparable countries (0.32 per cent of GDP). It's far less than so-called “like-minded countries” such as Britain, Norway and Denmark spend, and nowhere near the United Nations' longstanding target of having developed countries devote 0.7 per cent of GDP to aid.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">More to the point, it's just half of what Canada used to spend on foreign aid under prime ministers Pierre <b>Trudeau</b> and Brian Mulroney, when this country was a leader in the area and put aside 0.5 per cent of GDP.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's not realistic to expect the government to go that far anytime soon. The country has many other pressing priorities. But it is reasonable to expect that a government which proclaims its commitment to what it calls “progressive internationalism” should do a lot better than it has done so far.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That means reversing the gradual decline in international assistance and bringing Canada up to at least the average level of comparable countries. It should start doing that in its next budget.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Of course, the Liberals haven't been completely inactive on the development front.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Back in June, the prime minister announced Canada's new “feminist international assistance policy”[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/06/09/trudeaus-new-feminist-plan-commits-95-of-foreign-aid-to-gender-women-and-girls-by-2022.html] aimed at empowering women and girls. But it came with no new dollars attached; the money was reallocated from other parts of the existing aid budget.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That, at the same time Ottawa found billions of dollars more to devote to national defence.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The government also announced it will create a new “development finance institution” in Montreal[http://international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/multilateral-multilateraux/dfi-ifd.aspx?lang=eng], with an initial capitalization of $300 million. This was originally a Harper government proposal, and is aimed at partnering with private sector investors to support initiatives in developing countries.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When it gets up and running, the new institution may well play a useful role in channeling private capital into development projects. But it can't be a substitute for government-backed international assistance; private money won't address issues like the unprecedented flow of migrants or famine arising from climate change.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The government is right to lean against the dangerous trends toward isolationism and nativism that are sweeping much of the world. Canada should play an active, progressive role. Doing our full part in international assistance is an essential part of that – and the time to step up is now.</p>\n",

       " </div><div class=\"author\">James Trottier </div><div>The Province</div>\n",
       " <div>731 words</div><div>15 January 2018</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 Vancouver Province </div>\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland announced that their countries would co-host a conference on North Korea in Vancouver on Jan. 16. On Jan. 1, meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un offered to talk with South Korea, which responded positively.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Unfortunately, the Vancouver Conference will fail to achieve its objective of persuading North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. But the initiative will strengthen the hand of those within the <b>Trump</b> administration and beyond advocating for diplomatic rather than military action.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The premise of the conference - to force North Korea to the negotiating table and persuade it to denuclearize - is fatally flawed since the U.S. insists on North Korea's commitment to denuclearize as a precondition for any negotiations. It's a commitment North Korea will never make. Ironically, then, it may be South Korea itself, fresh off its own talks with North Korea, that sows the seeds of discord over the hardline approach of the U.S.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada may simply be a host rather than a substantive policy catalyst at the conference. Even worse, the description of Tillerson's visit as an opportunity \"to map out a strategy for dealing with North Korea's growing nuclear threat\" suggests that Canada may risk being drawn into a closer alignment with a failed U.S. policy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nor will Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s suggestion of a Cuban role lead to progress.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">North Korea has not listened to China; it certainly would not be persuaded by Cuba.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The conference is also undermined because Tillerson has only a tenuous hold on his position. The White House loses no opportunity to undercut his attempts at diplomacy on North Korea. Some may think that this is a deliberate game of \"good cop/bad cop\" but it seems more a case of \"confused cop,\" reflecting a fundamental disagreement inside the <b>Trump</b> administration on how to deal with North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Confusion is never good in foreign policy, especially in such a volatile situation, exacerbated by loose talk in Washington of pre-emptive strikes.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Such threats will not intimidate North Korea but will deepen its distrust and may prompt rash action if it feels threatened. It also provides North Korea a wedge with which to divide South Korea from the U.S. by offering talks to the South without American nuclear preconditions. U.S. policy-makers are divided between those such as Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who support diplomacy, and <b>Trump</b>'s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who views the threat of military action and possibly even a limited military strike as the only means of persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. Both sides are vying for the attention of <b>Trump</b>, who himself is inclined to a hardline position.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Seen in this context, the conference will assist in shoring up those who support a diplomatic approach, buying time for the eventual development of a new approach that would begin with recognition that North Korea is already a de facto nuclear state, that North Korea considers its nuclear program vital to its survival, that China will only press North Korea so far and that sanctions have a limited impact on North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Despite sanctions, the latter's economy grew by 3.9 per cent in 2016, according to South Korea's Bank of Korea, and the latest round of sanctions include significant loopholes insisted on by China and Russia.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">An alternative policy would turn from futile efforts to persuade North Korea to denuclearize toward de-escalation and containment strategies.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">How to prevent further nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia and beyond needs to be addressed.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The U.S. and its allies will not be ready to discuss the possibility of such a shift in Vancouver. Meanwhile, North Korea will continue to test and seek to divide South Korea from the Americans. Threats will be exchanged and the impasse will continue with the risk of miscalculation, conflict and unintended consequences.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">James Trottier is a former Canadian diplomat who directed programs at embassies in South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, served at the Permanent Mission of Canada to the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> and led four Canadian diplomatic delegations to North Korea in 2015 and 2016.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It was an act of cowardice and complicity when Canada abstained from voting 'Yes'to rejecting <b>Trump</b>'s ridiculous and illegal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This act of Israel and the US, is a blatant aggression. It is profoundly sad that those who suffered the Nazi holocaust would then inflict similar aggressions on the Palestinian people. Canada is complicit in this, to our great shame.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Truth is the daughter of Time: our acts of cowardice and complicity will not remain obscured by propaganda, and they will not be erased. I used to be proud to be a Canadian; to live in a country that seemed to act with integrity, and with respect for truth and justice. I thought with Justin <b>Trudeau</b> as our Prime Minister we could return to having a leader that acted with courage and justice. It appears not.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In November 2012, 138 nations voted in favour of giving <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> nonmember state status to the \"State of Palestine.\" Nine countries opposed the motion, 41 abstaining.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On November 30, 151 nations supported a General Assembly resolution, condemning Israeli actions in Syria's Golan and East Jerusalem, calling them \"null and void.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Six nations voted \"no'; Canada was one of these. In this latest vote, <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> member states supporting the resolution called actions by Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on Jerusalem illegal and therefore null and void. These states stood for justice. Anyone who knows any history is aware that Palestine was once a large place that was only reduced in size over the last century, as Israel expanded itself mostly through illegal means.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Why are we not among those who are standing for truth and justice? Canada is not a little America; nor do we want to be. It seems you willfully forget this.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Indeed, there is irony in quoting the words of Elie Weisel: \"We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must -at that moment -become the center of the universe.\"</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“If it was your son, would you do anything to stop this?”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This was the question posed directly to Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> by Fatouma, the sister of Abdoul Abdi, at a town hall event in Halifax this week.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Abdi's is a tragic story that highlights the gaps in Canadian institutions and systems that disproportionately and negatively impact Black Canadians.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Abdi came to Canada as a child refugee from Somalia in 2000 with his sister and aunts. His mother died in a refugee camp while awaiting the three-year process that eventually landed his family here.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Under uncertain circumstances, of which his family continues to seek clarification due to language barriers at the time, the Nova Scotia Department of Community Services removed a 7-year-old Abdi and his sister from the care of their aunt. Over the next decade the siblings were separated and Abdi was shuffled between 31 homes.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Abdi's aunt never stopped fighting for guardianship, and while she obtained her own citizenship she was denied the opportunity to apply for citizenship on behalf of her niece and nephew. While under child protection, Abdi was provided insufficient support to navigate the process of becoming a Canadian citizen on his own.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He was failed by the very system that was meant to protect him.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For child welfare advocates, Abdi's story and path from care to the criminal justice system is a familiar one. For the crimes he committed in his youth, which included aggravated assault, time has justly been served. At the moment of his release, as he prepared to reunite with his family and reintegrate into society, Abdi was detained once more.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Without his citizenship in place, Abdi was left vulnerable to the immigration process that could possibly lead to deportation.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Standing shoulder-to-shoulder to speak truth to power, advocates across Canada have spoken out with a resounding roar on Abdi's behalf, garnering attention and seeking immediate remedy for his case.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In response to Fatouma's question, <b>Trudeau</b> emphasized compassion and empathy while outlining the ways in which he recognized Canadian systems failed Abdi.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“It opened our eyes to something that many of us knew was ongoing in many communities but we continue to need to address,” he said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While his response was well informed, I would have liked to hear the prime minister name systemic anti-Black racism as a key factor to be addressed.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We need to directly acknowledge the cracks in our government systems through which Black Canadians are falling through at disproportionately high rates so that we can proactively tackle them.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">South of our border, the president of the United States has continued his divisive political agenda anchored in anti-Black racism. After hearing of his comments this week I wonder how his defenders continue to uphold him as a leader.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Characterizing Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations as “s---hole countries,” in an immigration meeting <b>Trump</b> reportedly asked, “Why do we need more Haitians? Take them out.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As thousands of Haitian families look to Canada in the wake of the <b>Trump</b> administration's decision to rescind deportation protections from nearly 60,000 Haitian refugees following the devastation of the 2010 earthquake, I hope Canada will show the compassion and empathy our prime minister talked about in his town hall this week and take them in.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada should be aiming for nothing less than global leadership in the steps we take to address anti-Black racism. To do this successfully we will need active engagement from Canadian political leaders.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">They should be proactively partnering with Black communities to identify priorities, set goals, communicate them publicly, and track progress toward success.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's difficult to engage in dialogue about policy while Abdi and his family live in crisis, facing this terrifying uncertainty. I hope this nightmare is over for them very soon.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But how is it fair that his story be used to advance public policy before his own livelihood is restored?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It is time for him to be reunited with his family so they may begin the long journey of healing from these painful experiences. That is what's fair.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In politics, it's Mitt Romney, Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, Caroline Mulroney and now Oprah.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Winfrey first flirted with politics back in 2008 when she endorsed then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. It is estimated that her support of Obama generated more than a million votes for the candidate and played a significant role in his fundraising capacity.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Since then, Winfrey has never indicated she would be interested in running for the U.S. presidency. As recently as this summer, Winfrey said she would not run for public office, let alone for president.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">How the tides have turned. And now, anticipation is running high. Oprah's speech at the Golden Globes on Sunday electrified audiences the world over and inspired media to spill thousands of barrels of ink on her potential presidential ambitions.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It triggered 3.1 billion social media impressions, the hashtag #Oprah2020 was part of 50,255 tweets and the numbers go on.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Speculation about celebrities with political aspirations is not new. Just about every presidential election cycle since the Reagan years has seen celebrities hint about running.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">However, those flirtations were usually dismissed as improbable, if not outright impossible. Conventional wisdom held that despite initial enthusiasm the lack of conventional political infrastructure doomed these ventures from the start.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b>'s election to the presidency fundamentally altered that long-entrenched view.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The fact that news networks, pundits, social media and water-cooler analysts are taking the #Oprah2020 hashtag seriously is because <b>Trump</b> has legitimized the idea that a celebrity can come from outside one of the two old-line political parties and take the Oval Office. As a result, a famous television host becoming the leader of the free world no longer seems crazy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Perhaps more importantly, the speed and intensity with which Winfrey was able to gain legitimate momentum last week demonstrates that voters are willing to think seriously and differently about what type of person they want to hold high public office.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Does someone's celebrity alone qualify them to be president or prime minister? Does it matter what has made them famous? Is this a new way of looking at things or is it merely an evolution of a path we have been on for some time?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It goes without saying, Oprah is in a class with very few others. She is a woman with a very significant following, and with good reason. She has acted as a spiritual leader and symbol of unity in America for decades. She is one of only a handful of people who is recognizable on a first name-only basis.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There are persuasive arguments that a President Winfrey could be a healing presidency; one that may be sorely needed after four years of division under an aggressive president who has significantly exacerbated previously existing tensions.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But there remain other challenges.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The presidency of the United States, like all elected positions, doesn't come with training wheels. They are complex positions that require leadership, expertise and experience; a sophisticated grasp of the intricacies of public policy and a strong understanding of how power is wielded.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When it comes time to choose our leaders, hopefully we think about his or her experience, qualifications, love of country, dedication, purpose, ideology, policy and legislative expertise.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Hopefully, we don't think too much about a candidate's social media followers, television ratings, product lines, award acceptance speeches, hair or whether they'd be a great person with whom to have a drink.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Celebrities often bring strong advocacy skills. They are often powerful at raising money, awareness and changing people's opinions. They are often persuasive, empathetic, expert communicators.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And that's a great start. But what doesn't follow is a fluency in the sphere of democratic institutions and public policy initiatives. Being a democratic leader requires much more than speaking louder than everyone else. Or having more followers on <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The fix to what currently ails the American presidency is not more of what injured it in the first place. The challenges of this presidency, the challenges that so many Americans chafe against, will not be solved by doubling down. It may well be better to change course altogether.</p>\n",

The talks, he said, are \"moving along nicely.\" There's \"no rush.\" And so forth.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nonetheless, it would be hard to say the negotiations were going exactly swimmingly. And in view of the week's confusion, it's worth asking just what the <span class=\"companylink\">government of Canada</span>'s strategy is. Presumably it had some reason for panicking the markets as it did on Wednesday. Perhaps it was simply to spook the administration. Or to advertise its own readiness to stare into the abyss of abrogation. But if unpredictability is the effect <b>Trudeau</b>'s people are after, someone please tell them they've succeeded.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On the one hand, they are prone to occasional fits of bluster, as in the lately disclosed suit before the <span class=\"companylink\">World Trade Organization</span>, attacking the whole history of American use of countervail and anti-dumping laws to harass and restrict imports, not just from Canada, but the rest of the world. In the same vein, one assumes, was the ill-fated attempt to blackmail <span class=\"companylink\">Boeing</span> into abandoning its trade remedy suit against Bombardier, by threatening not to purchase <span class=\"companylink\">Boeing</span>-made \"Super Hornets\" for the Air Force - which bluff being called, ended with the government having to buy second-hand planes from Australia.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On the other hand, there is that sudden burst of \"creative thinking\" on the Canadian side, as the Foreign Affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, described it, with regard to two of the <b>Trump</b> administration's most vexatious demands: increased North American and even American content requirements for autos, and eliminating the binational dispute resolution panels provided for by the treaty's famous Chapter 19. Perhaps on closer examination, these will not prove to be the concessions they appear, but they hardly sit well with the pugnacious pose the government was striking elsewhere.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This kind of good copbad cop routine is common in negotiations, of course. The question is just who it is aimed at: our negotiating partners, or the domestic audience? Is the tough talk intended to advance our demands, or to provide political cover for a retreat? Are we even trying to reach an agreement, or just preparing the political ground for the talks'inevitable collapse? For all the attention that has been paid to the demands the <b>Trump</b> administration has brought to the table, preposterous as they are, the <b>Trudeau</b> government has brought a few non-starters of its own: the same familiar Liberal hobby horses - gender, climate change, Indigenous rights - that helped scupper a final agreement on the Trans Pacific Partnership, and prevented talks from getting under way with China.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">To be fair, if there's confusion on the Canadian side, it is more than matched on the other. The president himself changes his mind with the weather; his administration is sharply divided between business-minded free traders and militant economic nationalists; and beyond the administration lies the Congress, now just 10 months away from elections.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Navigating those divisions would take on particular importance, should <b>Trump</b> make good on his threats and trigger <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>'s Article 2205, giving six months'notice of his intent to withdraw from the agreement. For, while the president can formally withdraw from <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, most legal scholars believe Congress would have to pass legislation giving it practical effect.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Hence the <b>Trudeau</b> government's multi-pronged lobbying campaign: one part aimed at officials in the <b>Trump</b> administration, one part pressing Canada's case with as many other of America's many power centres as it can manage - not only Congressional leaders, but state governors, mayors, and business associations.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Whether any of this is working is another question. Early attempts to cosy up to <b>Trump</b> himself appear to have been abandoned, but the broader diplomatic initiative seems no further ahead: Maclean's reports \"a realization is setting in that the charm offensive has not had its desired effect.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That, rather than any grand master plan, could explain Canada's welter of conflicting stances. There may, in fact, be very little anyone outside America can do to save <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>: whether it lives or dies may rather depend on internal American politics, over which we can have little influence. In which case, perhaps it is better to quit trying. Certainly there seems little point in making concessions, such as on auto content, that risk turning <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> into a Fortress North America, saving continental free trade at the cost of raising barriers against the rest of the world.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is, after all, a rather large wild card in all this: the president may no longer be president a year from now.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Conflict of interest, obstruction of justice, Russian collusion, his own health - there are any number of possible grounds on which he might conceivably be impeached or otherwise removed from office, especially if, as currently seems likely, the Republicans take a pasting in the mid-terms.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I still wouldn't bet on it but, until the situation clears, there's an argument for playing for time - smiling, talking, not leaving the table but never actually coming to an agreement.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Our series, \"Politics for the rest of us,\" continues today. It's an attempt to see if Canadians can find common ground, without resorting to name-calling and insults. Today, meet a would-be senator who offers some sober second thought: When the <b>Trudeau</b> government announced that regular people could apply to be considered for a Senate appointment in 2016, Isabel Gibson of Ottawa jumped in. She created a website, along with a social media campaign to promote her candidacy. The 65-year-old, mostly retired business editor knew the odds were not in her favour, but why not try? The married mother of two adult children holds a BA and an MBA but did not get the appointment. Instead, she became an aspiring photographer, videographer and storyteller.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">You'd expect a candidate to the Senate to be highly involved in politics, but in this case you'd be wrong. The point of her candidacy was that she was thoroughly independent. She follows the news, and voted Conservative in 2015 and 2011, but doesn't march, organize or write letters.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She herself describes her political philosophy as muddled. \"For years I was a reflexive Liberal voter,\" she explains. As a young person, she believed the world ought to be kinder and gentler and that government could help it along by levelling economic outcomes. But as she grew older, \"I've seen the ill effects of being given everything, contrasted with the value of working for things, both material things and accomplishments. I've come to appreciate the importance of each of us doing the work it takes to look after ourselves and our neighbours, rather than pushing this off on government.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Today she's a fiscal conservative. She's against abortion, though she wouldn't legislate against it, but she supports gay marriage and the legalization of most drugs.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She's not a fan of U.S.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">President Donald <b>Trump</b>. \"I don't like his bragging style that plays fast-and-loose with the truth and that never admits a mistake. I'm not impressed with what his behaviour reveals about his character, and I think that character matters in political life.\" At the same time, she concludes he gets some issues right, such as his eagerness to reduce regulations, his support for Israel, and his appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. \"Everything I heard Gorsuch say sounded wellreasoned and thoughtful,\" she says.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She believes <span class=\"companylink\">Canada's government</span> institutions are largely honest. \"I think we expect fair treatment from government at every level - and have reasonably affordable recourse when we feel wronged - which is essential to a peaceful and law-abiding country. By and large, we don't fear our government institutions or have objective reason to do so.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Still, she adds, our institutions are far from perfect. If she could make changes, she would have the legislative branch doing better at holding the executive accountable, \"so that electing a majority government didn't effectively make the PMO a four-year dictatorship.\" She would limit the terms of senators to five years, and she would limit the Senate's ability to veto or hold up legislation to no more than six months.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Gibson believes Canadians broadly agree on what makes a good society, and tend to disagree more on means than on ends.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She would, however, like to see Canadians lose their smugness and self-righteousness, \"especially vis-à-vis Americans, and the frequent conflation of 'caring'values with the Liberal party.\" She would eliminate all tax deductions and credits and institute a guaranteed annual income to replace all \"social programs that just redistribute wealth.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She wants to see improvements to Indigenous affairs reach a point, over the next generation or two, where every Indigenous Canadian is \"as integrated as they chose to be (versus assimilated), with all the individual rights and liberties that would involve.\" She would also like to see non-Indigenous Canadians gain better knowledge and understanding of Indigenous culture and accomplishments.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If she could change one thing to improve our political discourse, \"I'd introduce rationality and perspective,\" she says - gradually.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"Our current discourse is characterized by strongly emotional responses and by a lack of perspective. Before engaging, we might stop to consider how small our policy differences really are (looked at in an international or historical context), and how well off we are and how small our problems are (again, compared to those in other countries or any other period in history).\" Brigitte Pellerin is a writer, mother of three, competitive martial artist, runner and photographer who lives in Ottawa. bp@brigittepellerin.com <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span>: @bpellerin.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Concerns about the corrosive effects of extreme inequality are nothing new. In the 4th century B.C., for example, Plato wrote that no person should be more than four times wealthier than any other, lest the divide lead to laziness among the rich and stifle opportunity for the poor.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He would not be very pleased, then, by a new report from the <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</span>, which shows that the country's 100 highest-paid CEOs make more than 200 times the average income – a ratio unprecedented in Canada's history. Nor would he be impressed to learn that the two richest Canadians own as much wealth as the poorest 30 per cent combined.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is much disagreement about the causes of rising inequality, but much less about its effects: the decline of trust and social cohesion, the threats to democracy, the impact on economic growth of shrunken demand. The astounding gaps that have emerged between the richest and the rest are not only unfair, but also dangerous in their unfairness. As Justin <b>Trudeau</b> said after Donald <b>Trump</b> won the presidency, Trumpism triumphed in part because many in America felt they were not sharing in their country's prosperity and this is a situation Ottawa must work to avoid.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Yet one of the federal government's most powerful tools for containing growing inequality, the tax system, is not nearly as effective as it once was in reducing income disparities. Surely that's one of the reasons Finance Minister Bill Morneau declared tax fairness his top priority and promised to review the tax code in search of loopholes that benefit the rich and make no discernible contribution to the public good. Last year's small-business tax reform fiasco, disastrous for reasons largely unrelated to the package's policy purpose, was the first result of this review. The new numbers from the CCPA should serve as a reminder that, however politically painful the project, Ottawa cannot stop there.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In an opinion piece that appeared on the opposite page earlier this week, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh proposed two sensible steps the federal government can take to ensure that corporate executives are not padding their salaries at the expense of other taxpayers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, the Liberals should finally do as they promised during the election campaign and close the tax break on executive stock options.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Currently, compensation received in the form of stock options is taxed at a much lower rate than regular income. The tax break was conceived, in part, to help capital-starved start-ups attract top talent, but has been co-opted by executives at established companies as a way to reduce their tax load. Until recently, Ottawa lost about $1 billion every year through the loophole, more than 90 per cent of which went to the top 1 per cent of earners.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In 2013, for instance, 75 of Canada's 100 top-paid CEOs received part of their income as stock options. This allowed them to accrue combined savings of $495 million, or $6.6 million each. That's half a billion dollars of forgone revenue to subsidize 75 very rich people.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Moreover, it's not at all clear that incenting companies to compensate employees with stock options is really such a good idea. The evidence suggests it encourages CEOs to drive up expectations, and thus stock prices, not necessarily results.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Some start-up executives have expressed concern that closing the loophole might drive innovators out of the country, particularly in light of the <b>Trump</b> regime's low-tax frenzy. These arguments seem to have convinced Morneau et al. to back off. Of course, those who benefit from the loophole have every reason to make that case, whatever its merits. In any case, surely there is a way to help small enterprises without requiring an annual billion-dollar public gift that mostly benefits those who have nothing to do with start-ups.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Closing or capping this loophole would be a good start, but as the CCPA report points out, companies are already finding workarounds in anticipation of a crackdown by Ottawa. Instead of offering stock options, it seems, many companies are simply compensating their executives with stocks.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Hence Singh's second proposal: increasing the inclusion rate for capital gains of CEOs. Currently, only 50 per cent of such investment income is taxable. Many have suggested the inclusion rate is too low. Over 50 years ago, the Carter Commission, the last comprehensive review of Canada's tax system, argued against giving excessively favourable treatment to investment income compared to earned income. After all, as the commission famously concluded, “a buck is a buck.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Moreover, as the CCPA data on compensation shows, this tax break creates enormous benefits for those who need it least. The inclusion rate for capital gains costs Ottawa about $3.8 billion per year, 87 per cent of which goes to the top 1 per cent of earners.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Wealthy people can afford the very best accountants and financial advisers to help them find creative ways, unavailable to most, to reduce their tax load. The lost revenue and unfairness compound inequality and erode trust. Over decades, Canadian tax policy, with its proliferation of loopholes, has been taking us in the wrong direction. The <b>Trudeau</b> government seemed to understand this when it promised to change course. It should follow through.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland announced in Ottawa that the United States and Canada will cohost a conference of Foreign Ministers on North Korea in Vancouver on Jan. 16. On Jan. 1, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un offered to talk with South Korea, which responded positively.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Unfortunately, the Vancouver Conference will fail to achieve its stated objective of persuading North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. However, the initiative will strengthen the hand of those within the Donald <b>Trump</b> administration and beyond (including South Korea) who are advocating for diplomatic rather than military action.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The conference can be expected to reaffirm sanctions and policies that have not worked, rather than discuss new approaches. In this regard, it is unfortunate China is not among the listed invitees. Without China, the conference risks being an echo chamber of the likeminded.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The premise of the conference - to force North Korea to the negotiating table and persuade it to denuclearize - is fatally flawed, since the U.S. insists on North Korea's commitment to denuclearize as a precondition for any discussions between the two. It's a commitment North Korea will never make. Ironically, it may be South Korea, fresh off its talks with North Korea, that sows the seeds of discord over the hard-line approach of the U.S.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada may simply be a host rather than a substantive policy catalyst. Even worse, the description of Tillerson's visit as an opportunity \"to map out a strategy for dealing with North Korea's growing nuclear threat\" suggests Canada risks being drawn into a closer alignment with a failed U.S. policy driven by the whims of an erratic president.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nor will Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s suggestion of a Cuban role lead to progress. North Korea has not listened to China; it certainly would not be persuaded by Cuba to denuclearize, even if Cuba were willing to engage in such messaging.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The conference is also undermined because Tillerson has only a tenuous hold on his position. The White House loses no opportunity to undercut his attempts at diplomacy on North Korea. Some may think this is a deliberate game of \"good cop/bad cop,\" but this seems more a case of \"confused cop,\" reflecting a fundamental disagreement inside the <b>Trump</b> administration on how to deal with North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Confusion is never good in foreign policy, especially in such a volatile situation, exacerbated by loose talk in Washington of pre-emptive strikes. Such threats will not intimidate North Korea but will deepen its distrust and may prompt rash action if it feels in imminent danger. It also provides North Korea a wedge with which to divide South Korea from the U.S. by offering talks to the South without American nuclear preconditions. U.S. policy-makers are divided between those such as Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who support diplomacy, and <b>Trump</b>'s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who views the threat of military action and possibly even a limited military strike (in the risky hope this will not prompt a massive North Korean response) as the only means of persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. Both sides are vying for the attention of <b>Trump</b>, who is inclined to a hard-line position.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Seen in this context, the Vancouver conference will assist in shoring up those who support a diplomatic approach, buying time for the eventual development of a new approach.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A new approach would begin with a quiet recognition that North Korea is already a de facto nuclear state; that North Korea considers its nuclear program vital to its survival and will not trade it for sanctions relief; that China will only press North Korea so far; and that for a variety of reasons, sanctions have a limited impact on North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Despite sanctions, the latter's economy grew by 3.9 per cent in 2016, according to South Korea's Bank of Korea, and the latest round of sanctions include significant loopholes insisted on by China and Russia.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">An alternative policy would turn from futile efforts to persuade North Korea to denuclearize toward de-escalation and containment strategies - including pressing North Korea to limit its arsenal and capacity with a mixture of diplomatic and economic pressure, incentives, military preparedness and security guarantees for regional allies. How to prevent further nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia and beyond needs to be addressed. This involves discussions directly with North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The U.S. and its allies will not be ready to discuss the possibility of such a shift in Vancouver. In the meanwhile, North Korea will continue to test and seek to divide South Korea from the Americans; threats will be exchanged; and the impasse will continue with the risk of miscalculation, conflict and unintended consequences.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, they're Liberals and elitists who relish having such a dashing feminist and environmentalist running the country (as opposed to that nasty Donald J. <b>Trump</b>), and therefore will not even consider the thought that he is running the country into the ground.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Second, <b>Trudeau</b> is not former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper which, in many liberal books, is as good an excuse as any to stop reading anything negative about their chosen one.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Trouble is, <b>Trudeau</b> isn't working for the middle class.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But he is screwing it. While the federal government likes to claim it has \"cut taxes for middle-class Canadians everywhere,\" the truth of the matter is that 81 per cent of middle-class Canadians are paying more income taxes under the Liberals'income-tax changes - some $840 more a year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Worse, more than 60 per cent of lower-income Canadians - meaning those in the bottom 20 per cent of wage-earners - are now paying more in federal income tax because of the same Liberal tax changes that they claim were brought in to supposedly help the middle class.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The total net tax bill for the average Canadian family exceeded $35,000 in 2017 - which is more than the average family spends on the combination of housing, food and clothing.</p>\n",

       " <span class=\"companylink\">The Fraser Institute</span>, which is unquestionably a conservative think-tank, but also just as unquestionably thorough in its research, doesn't paint a good picture of the state of our economy.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead of his promised \"modest\" deficit of $10 billion, it hit $18 billion in 2016, and $20 billion in the year that just ended.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Additional deficits of almost $80 billion are now being forecast over the next five years, with balanced budgets (or any plan to get there) found nowhere in a single Liberal's fiscal vocabulary.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Those who voted Liberal can only blame themselves, of course, and - if they also voted for Kathleen Wynne's Liberals in Ontario or Rachel Notley's NDP in Alberta - then it should come as no surprise that they've been both hoodwinked and taken to the cleaners.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's debt is stretching the balloon to the breaking point. Federal net debt, by itself, increased to $727 billion in 2016-17, with the provincial net debt sitting collectively at $633 billion.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Isolation, says Holden, is not racism. \"It's more of a 'selfish'attitude which means that we look after our family first, then the neighbours, city, province, country. Other countries come after our family (the homeless, sick, children, elderly) have eaten,\" he explains. \"Sociobiologists would call this genetic altruism. We look after people who are genetically closer to us. This is not racism, this is the real world.\"</p>\n",

I do support the movement of people across borders that can integrate, are educated and can add to the safety and wealth of a country. The Mexican people that I know are very industrious, they work tremendously hard, and they will learn to speak English. It's always a pleasure to live where I do in Mexico. I integrate, I pay my way. I learn as well as I can how to speak Spanish.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He supports <b>Trump</b>'s promise to \"drain the swamp\" that many feel the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. government</span> has become. \"Most of us are aware that wages have not increased for the majority in Canada or the U.S. since the mid-1980s yet illegal immigration has hurt Americans\" (and welfare to illegal aliens might hurt the incomes of Canadians also, he feels). Holden believes that the fact <b>Trump</b> is not a typical politician will help him move the U.S. economy forward. \"I hope that he succeeds.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Closer to home, Holden disliked former prime minister Pierre Elliott <b>Trudeau</b>, and is no fan of his son.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He's not sure how we can improve our political discourse. Indeed, his antipathy toward the current prime minister is so strong, it has led his daughter to unfriend him on <span class=\"companylink\">Facebook</span> due to his \"tirades.\" He believes young people today do not know how different it was to grow up in the 1950s and 1960s or to know the world of politics in the 1970s through the 1990s.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Many, he says, see Justin <b>Trudeau</b> as \"cute and trendy.\" Let's just say Holden disagrees. \"I grew up in a time when families budgeted and were prudent with money. <b>Trudeau</b> Sr. changed that. Divisive, trendy, and a huge spendthrift. He hurt Western Canada deeply. Now we have his son. A globalist. New World Order.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, is busy these days, but she still occasionally finds the time to dabble in her first career of journalism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In The Economist's special New Year's issue, “The World in 2018,”[http://www.theworldin.com] Freeland has penned an article about how Canada plans to battle global trends toward nationalism and protectionism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She calls it “progressive internationalism” and describes how Canada will be pursuing this idea in 2018 on two tracks: internationally, in the realms of human rights, immigration and freer trade; and domestically, with fairer taxation and improved labour standards here in Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The two tracks work together, Freeland says. Canadians won't support immigration, rights and trade if they feel they're paying an unfair price at home.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“Progressive trade is not a feint or a frill,” she writes. “It is fundamental to the furtherance of a trading system that will enjoy popular support.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Donald <b>Trump</b>'s name[https://www.thestar.com/news/donald-trump.html] doesn't appear in the article. But Freeland is sending a clear signal that Canada is on a path of resistance to all the forces that made <b>Trump</b> president of the United States, including income inequality.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“In most places where nativism has appeared as a political force, income inequality was there first,” Freeland writes. “That erodes workers' belief in the future. At worst, it undermines social cohesion, prompting unrest or revolution.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The article is a reminder of the issue that brought Freeland into politics. It was her book on income inequality, Plutocrats, that led to her initial meetings with Justin <b>Trudeau</b> and then the plunge into elected politics[https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/11/29/how-chrystia-freeland-became-justin-trudeaus-first-star.html] in 2013.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">More than four fascinating years later, Freeland's article in The Economist is also an argument that her work today as one of the top ministers in Prime Minister <b>Trudeau</b>'s cabinet is an experiment in fighting income inequality and <b>Trump</b>-style populism. Who better to wage battle against a plutocrat president, after all, than someone who has written books about that gold-plated world <b>Trump</b> inhabited before arriving in the White House?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But can “progressive internationalism” work against <b>Trump</b>-style populism? Well, as it happens, it's not the only such experiment under way in Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne is also in the midst of a large-scale effort to battle economic inequality, as she described it to Star columnist Martin Regg Cohn in a recent, year-end interview.[https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/12/19/wynne-wants-to-level-the-playing-field-for-ontarians.html]\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“I have a deep belief that we don't play on a level field, and so what can I do to level that playing field?” Wynne said in the interview. “It's our job as human beings to find ways to help each other, and so that for me is at the root of what government is about. We come together, and we decide as a society how we are going to support each other.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is a big temptation, an understandable one if you read the polls, to see these next few months in Ontario as the prelude to Wynne's departure and the end of the Liberals' 15-year hold on power in the province.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But even if this is an end game, it's an ambitious one on the anti-populism front, with big policy launches under way on everything from pharmacare to minimum wages to basic income. When I talked a couple of months ago about this experiment to Wynne's future campaign manager, David Herle, he described it this way:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“For people living outside Ontario, it is recognized as the most ambitious plan in the world to use liberalism to address the growing inequities in the economy and the political tumult that results,” Herle said.[https://ipolitics.ca/2017/11/14/politically-wynnes-hole-shes-changing-ontario/] It's a laboratory experiment, in other words, not unlike Freeland's “progressive internationalism.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Much has been written in the past few weeks about how 2017 was the year that Trumpism did NOT take hold in Canada. Candidates in the Conservative leadership race who might have reminded us of <b>Trump</b> — Kevin O'Leary, the entrepreneur-outsider, Kellie Leitch, the “Canada-first” contender — flared up and then faded away. No major political party in Canada, it's worth noting, has embraced the <b>Trump</b> attitudes toward trade or immigration.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Veteran pollster Michael Adams even asked the question in his new book, Could it Happen Here?[http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Could-It-Happen-Here/Michael-Adams/9781501177422] (“it” being <b>Trump</b>-style politics), and concluded that the answer is No — that Canada has had its own flirtations with populism in the past and has always climbed back from the brink.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But Freeland's article and Wynne's big policy rollouts are a signal that the battle in Canada against Trumpism isn't over — that, in fact, 2017 was just a preview of what's to come.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A year from now, we may be calling 2018 the year of the big political experiment by Liberals in Ottawa and Ontario. The ongoing effort to keep Trumpism out of Canada many turn out to be the most interesting part of politics this year.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is gathering gloom over the future of the North-American Free Trade Agreement. As negotiators prepare for what are said to be crucial sessions in Montreal in a couple of weeks, some trade experts say the deal is likely doomed at the hand of U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b>'s anti-NAFTA verbal trade war. As pessimism grows, a new idea has emerged in some circles: Maybe Canada should join <b>Trump</b> and dump Mexico as partner.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">After all, say these protectionists, Canada has lost thousands of auto jobs to Mexico since <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> was signed in 1994. Over the last two decades, Mexico's exports to Canada have grown faster than Canada's exports to Mexico, leaving a dreaded and growing \"trade deficit.\" Time to forget Mexico and go it alone with <b>Trump</b>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Such a betrayal has been in the speculation air for some time. In November, former Mexican president Vicente Fox warned Prime Minister <b>Trudeau</b> not to abandon Mexico. In a CTV interview, Fox said <b>Trudeau</b> \"might, like Judas, give us a strike and go with the United States and leave us (Mexico) aside. I warn <b>Trudeau</b>, and I warn Canada, you will not make it better (without Mexico).\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While it seems unlikely Canada will stab Mexico in the back, it is not outside the realm of possibility that Canadian policy leaders might be inclined to align with the views of Canada's labour leaders and other anti-free trade activists and support <b>Trump</b> on trade.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A review of the trade positions of the three nations suggests only one nation can be said to have a real interest in freer trade. The negotiation objectives announced by Canada and the United States are loaded with traderestricting provisions, including auto rules and labour conditions, while Mexico's priorities are at least focused on opening up the agreement to provide freer movement of goods, services and people within the continent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">President Enrique Pena Nieto's government has also indicated that if <b>Trump</b> kills <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico will move to cut tariffs. Within Mexico, members of the National Action Party - one of the country's opposition contenders - have said they would begin moving toward a radical free-trade program, including unilateral tariff reductions. Guillermo Romero, economy minister for the central state of Guanajuato, a major car-making hub, told Reuters that if <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> were somehow terminated, \"Mexico would open up to find different solutions and ways into trade.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead of musing about a possible North American trade environment without <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, Canada should consider joining Mexico in a hard-line joint position that directly confronts <b>Trump</b>'s trade protectionism. The United States may need <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> more than Canada and Mexico - a possibility acknowledged by many U.S. politicians and industries. No sector is more acutely aware of the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> risk than the automobile industry.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As the Financial Post's Alicja Siekierska reported this week, <b>Trump</b>'s trade strategy looms as a threat to the U.S. auto industry. The key element of the <b>Trump</b> plan is to raise the mandated North American content of automobiles manufactured on the continent to 85 per cent from the current 62.5 per cent. <b>Trump</b> also wants to add a requirement for 50 per cent U.S. content.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Vehicles and parts that don't meet the <b>Trump</b> thresholds would face tariffs of 2.5 per cent - or maybe higher. The United States, in other words, would be forcing Canada and Mexico to participate in an uncompetitive tradeprotection scheme at a time when the global industry is becoming hyper-competitive.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Without <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, the United States risks adding isolating elements to its auto sector at a time when the globalization of the industry continues to expand. If anything, in a world of rising auto production and demand, the U.S. auto industry and North American consumers should be looking for even lower barriers to trade, not more of them.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Mexico is already well on the way to trade expansion outside North America. A 2016 report from the Michiganbased Center for Automotive Research (CAR) says Mexico is poised to take advantage of its own aggressive freetrade agenda outside <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Over the last 10 years alone, Mexico's auto production has increased 140 per cent to six million units. According to CAR, \"the ceiling for Mexican automotive manufacturing capacity has no bounds,\" given the country's lower costs, expanding port facilities on two coasts, increasing expertise and expanding infrastructure.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That unbound future includes much more than auto consumers in Canada and the United States. Mexico has free-trade agreements with 44 other countries that allow it to export vehicles duty free to areas that account for 47 per cent of global demand for new autos - including Europe, where Mexico is exempt from the 10 per cent tariff on imported vehicles facing U.S. auto makers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The CAR report says \"no other country in the world boasts an equivalent export environment. With easy access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Mexico's access to global markets has been a powerful tool in attracting automotive investment. This is particularly true for automakers such as <span class=\"companylink\">BMW</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">Audi</span>, which specifically plan for their Mexico operations to be global export hubs for the vehicles produced there.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> is still the heart of Mexico's auto trade. But it is not Mexico's only option over the long run. In 20 or 30 years, as Mexico's economy expands under progressive adoption of free-trade policies, the country's industrial development promises to propel it to new heights.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead of seeing Mexico as a trade-deficit enemy - a false premise to start with - Canada should join Mexico and take a stand for freer trade. Over the long run, the United States has everything to lose.</p>\n",

       " </div><div class=\"author\">By J.J. McCullough </div><div>833 words</div><div>4 January 2018</div><div>Washington Post.com</div><div>WPCOM</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. </div>\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A curious side effect of American political polarization may be the decline of Canadian anti-Americanism.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Though conceptualizing Canadians as a people who are, before anything else, \"not American\" is a centuries-old tradition, over the past 40 years this contrarianism has congealed around a narrower notion that Canadian not-Americanness is (or should be) defined through Canada's embrace of policies and politicians to the left of American norms — stricter gun control, government-run health insurance, etc. It's a conclusion assuming a high degree of national homogeneity — that Americans all basically think one way and Canadians another. If 2017 has demonstrated nothing else, however, it's that neither nation is so easily generalized.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">2017 saw Bernie Sanders travel to Toronto and lavish praise on a Canadian health-care system that polls suggest the majority of Democratic voters want to copy. Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> became a global celebrity thanks to a giddy fan base of American progressives. Canadian liberals are used to being fetishized by a certain sort of American, but 2017 proved that the love is becoming far more mutual, as when thousands of Canadian women joined street protests against a freshly inaugurated President <b>Trump</b>. I grew up hearing smug Canadian leftists sneer that the \"most liberal Democrat is still to the right of a Canadian Conservative.\" No one says that much anymore.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">More significant, however, is the fact that so much of North American political debate now focuses far less on government policy and programs than social-cultural trends, most of which are not exclusive to one side of the continent. Canada's American-bashers have traditionally made their case playing up weirdness in American government because it's the easiest distraction from the vast cultural similarities of the two nations. That task is much harder when politics becomes less about congressmen and prime ministers, and more about lived experiences that transcend country.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The #MeToo movement, for instance, which Time magazine declared the most newsworthy phenomena of 2017, can hardly be regarded by Canadians as some exotic \"American\" thing. In a recent poll, a majority of Canadian working women reported that they had experienced sexual harassment, at rates little different from those found by American pollsters. Though not part of the domino effect that followed the Harvey Weinstein allegations, recent years have seen the standing of once-powerful Canadian men toppled overnight by allegations of misconduct, most notably radio host Jian Ghomeshi, two members of parliament, and, last fall, the head of Montreal's acclaimed Just for Laughs comedy festival. When Canadian-born Hollywood stars such as Rachel McAdams, Ellen Page and Sarah Polley spoke publicly about harassment, they spoke only as women — with no attempt to frame their experiences as something foreign. The Canadian entertainment industry, for its part, has promised to create an industry-wide code of conduct to fight what the president of the Toronto actors' union called a \"prevalent\" problem.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The United States' renewed interest in racial justice has been similarly mirrored across the border. All big Canadian cities now have their own branch of Black Lives Matter, and viral phenomena, like Kendall Jenner's tone-deaf Pepsi commercial or football players taking a knee, reliably provoke national conversations in Canada as well. \"Racism is not just an American problem, it's a Canadian problem too,\" concluded a local story on Black Lives Matter Calgary.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But the backlash to all this has also transcended borders.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " <span class=\"companylink\">University of Toronto</span> psychologist Jordan B. Peterson was easily one of the most prominent Canadian celebrities of 2017, earning continent-wide acclaim in conservative circles — and disdain in progressive ones — for his passionate denunciations of contemporary left-wing causes, particularly gender fluidity. When <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> employee James Damore was fired last August after his infamous memo on gender differences, it was to Peterson's sympathetic ear that he gave one of his first extended interviews, recognizing the professor's reach.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Legions of young Canadian men blog and meme-war about <b>Trump</b> with little sense that it's a foreign fight; the president's crusade against his stock enemies — political correctness, \"globalists,\" the \"fake news\" media — is one in which they find <span class=\"companylink\">common cause</span>. Canadians such as Stefan Molyneux, Faith Goldy and Lauren Southern have become major figures in the immigration-bashing alt-right counterculture, a movement that, paradoxically enough, tends to demonstrate its \"nationalism\" by elevating transnational concepts like \"whiteness\" or \"the West\" above patriotism for any particular nation-state.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The pervasiveness of Canadian anti-Americanism has always been one of history's more unlikely phenomena, given the two countries have always been deeply integrated at the cultural, economic and familial level, while bigotries tend to be fueled by ignorance and isolation. The most common explanation has been that Canadians crave a distinct sense of self, but as the most powerful identities of North American life become more personal and tribal, expect this motive to fade as well.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b> has now informed the world that he has a bigger nuclear button than the leader of North Korea. It would be funny, if the lives of millions were not at stake.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> either does not value, or does not understand, diplomacy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Perhaps our country can do better? We learned with happy surprise on Nov. 28 that our government will host a diplomatic initiative.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Excitedly, many of us combed our news sources for the aims and details of this gathering. Thus far the fruits of our labour have been meagre.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What will actually happen in Vancouver on Jan. 16?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">To opt for diplomacy instead of military force is surely a good thing. And it has been encouraging to read about how Canada may be able to earn North Korea's trust more easily than the U.S. The comment by one Canadian official that Canada is looking for \"better ideas\" than those currently before us is another positive sign, as is <b>Trudeau</b>'s suggestion that Canada's relationship with Cuba might give us a channel through which to talk to North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But the Vancouver meeting also has unsettling characteristics.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">First, Canada's partner in organizing the gathering is the United States, an implacable foe of North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> and his secretary of defence have recently threatened to commit genocide against the DPRK.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Second, most of the countries to be represented in Vancouver are those that sent troops in the Korean War to fight against North Korea. Might not the North Koreans see this meeting as a step in the formation of a Coalition of the Willing, similar to what preceded the invasion of Iraq in 2003?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Third, it appears North Korea will have no spokesperson in Vancouver. But the current crisis is a manifestation of an underlying conflict, and how can that conflict be solved without consulting one of the main antagonists? Will this be like the Bonn process of 2001 that sorted out the Afghan conflict without consulting the <span class=\"companylink\">Taliban</span>? That has not turned out well.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland talks about the coming meeting, she stresses its diplomatic nature, but U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has characterized it as a means to increase pressure on North Korea.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Pressure? The <span class=\"companylink\">UN Security Council</span> is already putting such extreme pressure on North Korea that its existence as an industrialized country is threatened and its people may face starvation. What state could survive a 90-per-cent cut in its oil supply?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But if increasing pressure does not qualify as a \"better idea,\" what would?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Here are four ideas. We believe they offer the only realistic hope of a genuine peace:</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Stop insulting North Korea. Banish the term \"rogue state.\" Forget about who has a bigger nuclear button. Treat the country's leadership as sane, rational and capable of being a partner in a peace process.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Build trust and confidence gradually through positive action. It is not necessary that all such action be economic, but there should certainly be relief from the current economic stranglehold. A series of symbolic exchanges, artistic and athletic, should be part of the plan.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Recognize that North Korea has valid security concerns and that the desire to have a nuclear deterrent grows out of these concerns.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Remember that the country went through a devastating war, has suffered repeated provocations and threats, and has endured targeting by U.S. nuclear weapons for more than 65 years.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Begin serious work toward a permanent peace treaty that will replace the ceasefire agreement of 1953. The U.S. must be a signatory of this treaty.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If we Canadians think a lasting peace with North Korea will be obtained by insulting and starving the population of that beleaguered country, we are as foolish, and as heartless, as those who put their faith in bombs.</p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">One strange development in 2017 was how U.S. politics became a lot more parliamentary while Canadian politics became at least a little congressional. As North America's economies prepared to start growing apart, North America's politics seemed to be converging.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">With Republican majorities in both houses of Congress and an at least nominal Republican in the White House, the way politics has worked in Washington since November 2016 is that the Republicans figure out what they want to do and, when they can agree, push it through Congress without even a look-see toward the Democrats.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That's pretty much how a parliamentary system works when the governing party has a majority. It's how majority government in this country has traditionally worked (even if - read on - a more independent Senate may be changing things). The majority party figures out what it wants to do and pushes its program through <span class=\"companylink\">Parliament</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Three-fold control isn't always how the U.S. system works.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In fact, the same party has held the presidency and both houses of Congress only 42 per cent of the time since 1945. But that's the way it's functioning - or dysfunctioning - for now.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When I began to get interested in U.S. politics, Lyndon Johnson was president and his watchword was \"Come, let us reason together.\" Sometimes presidents have no choice but to work with the other party. Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush the Elder never had a double congressional majority. Sometimes even when the president's party does run both chambers, he tries to bring members of the other party along. Doing so makes legislation more popular and therefore more permanent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There have also been times when party designations didn't mean much, policy-wise. For much of the 20th century, conservative Democrats voted like Republicans, while liberal Republicans often sided with Democrats. Bipartisanship, or at least partial bipartisanship, was a hallmark of the U.S. congressional system.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">These days, however, there's almost no \"working across the aisle.\" The Republicans decide big questions in their House and Senate caucuses and then try to get them passed. Senate rules that allow some things to go through with a simple majority rather than 60 votes reinforce that strategy.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Of course, even when the U.S. is in parliamentary mode, its system doesn't work exactly like ours. In some ways it works better. Intra-party policy debates take place out in the open and with the help of the press. Individual senators and congressmen periodically draw lines in the sand that leadership can't cross if it wants their votes. In some ways, that's a lot healthier than how we do it, which is by largely private back and forth among ministers, the prime minister and backbenchers. Rumours of dissent do get out now and then but caucus secrecy often seems as binding as cabinet secrecy and it's a rare backbencher that publicly threatens to vote against the party line if he doesn't get his or her way.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ironically, what keeps the U.S. system from channeling ours more directly is that its president isn't as imperial as our prime minister is (\"ironically\" because the idea of an \"imperial presidency\" was coined by the American historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.). At times, President Donald <b>Trump</b> has tried to intimidate different senators into voting his way, but generally without success. Partly because of his low popularity ratings, they seem insufficiently afraid of him, as some senators clearly were of Lyndon Johnson. By contrast, our prime minister, though a much more amiable sort, has power almost of life and death - of political life and death, that is - over his ministers and backbenchers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On the other hand, and this is how our system may be becoming more congressional, he no longer controls the Senate the way he used to. It was always a puzzle why senators, appointed essentially for life and removable only for cause, would kowtow to their party leader. But kowtow they usually did. Not any more though. The senators formerly known as Liberal have developed minds of their own, which they are increasingly and shamelessly feisty about exercising - despite their utter lack of democratic legitimacy. New, officially independent senators seem to think and act the same way. Because of our senators'newfound spunk, however illegitimate, we may see our prime ministers acting more like U.S. presidents: making public deals with senators, whether individually or in groups, so as to get their legislative agendas through.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The big puzzle about <b>Trump</b>'s first year in office is why someone so evidently non-ideological didn't broker legislative deals across parties. After this coming November, he may have no choice. In which case U.S. politics will go back to being at least slightly consensual, unless the players decide gridlock serves their interests best. As for us, with the Senate imposing itself, we may have to get consensual, too.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Justin <b>Trudeau</b>: Resolve to find a new vacation spot. Sure, Bells Cay, the private island belonging to the religious leader, billionaire and registered lobbyist the Aga Khan, is lavish and beautiful. And, of course, you have a known soft spot for sunny ways. But given that your yuletide trip to the island contravened Canada's conflict of interest law and contributed to a larger narrative about your government's coziness with billionaires, you might want to consider an alternative. We understand your finance minister has a lovely villa in the south of France …</p>\n",

Find an ordinary Canadian and ask. They'll be more than happy to explain that your important talk of tax fairness will ring hollow as long as you and your fellow ultra-rich appear to be exempt.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Andrew Scheer: Resolve to break up with The Rebel – actually. After winning the Tory leadership, you vowed to stop granting interviews to the far-right news organization, which was then under fire for its not-entirely-negative coverage of neo-Nazis. But The Rebel's objectionable editorial policies didn't stop you from hiring one of the outlet's directors, Hamish Marshall, as your campaign manager. You have promised a positive vision for Canada's future, one that unites rather than divides the country. The Rebel, meanwhile, sometimes runs columns that seem to deny the Holocaust happened. Do these seem consistent to you?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Donald <b>Trump</b>: Resolve to lie more. The startling compendium of mendacity compiled this year by the Star's Washington bureau chief and presidential fact-checker, Daniel Dale, shows that since taking office you've uttered more than 1,000 falsehoods. Sure, this debases your country's political discourse and undermines American democracy – but your wanton disregard for truth is also having another, more felicitous effect. Polls show that two-thirds of Americans don't believe your fabrications – and roughly the same proportion disapproves of your presidency. Keep it up in 2018!</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Men: Resolve to stop sexually harassing people. It's so important - and really not that difficult.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Kathleen Wynne: Resolve to go out, if you are indeed going to go out, with a bang, not a whimper. At this time last year, your support was hitting record lows. But as you enter this election year you're seeing a notable resurgence, no doubt in part because of the significant push finally to become the “social-justice premier” you once promised to be. In particular, your government's labour reforms, including a significant minimum-wage hike, and your plan for partial pharmacare are important steps toward a more just and prosperous Ontario. You even have Patrick Brown talking like a progressive. Don't stop now.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Daylight Saving Time: Resolve to disappear. Another year promises another two time changes, which in turn promise yet more danger and misery – and for what? Studies show that, by messing with our sleep patterns, time changes significantly increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and sleep disorders – not to mention the massive toll DST takes on our economy in the form of lost productivity. Enough! Please be gone and let us join the sensible 79 per cent of the global population who are already free of your foolishness.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Beverley McLachlin: Resolve to enjoy the writer's life. As you retire after nearly three decades as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and prepare to publish your first novel this year, we are confident you will bring the skills that defined your remarkable judicial career to bear in your literary pursuits as well. The key to good judging, you once said, is empathy, to “put yourself in the shoes of the different parties, and think about how it looks from their perspective.” That, of course, is also the key to good fiction. Plus, like judges, writers often work in robes. You'll be great.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Jagmeet Singh: Resolve to hit the books. Your charisma, sartorial style and positivity propelled you to the NDP leadership, but you haven't always shown an enthusiasm for that pesky other part of politics: public policy. Study up. Halfway through their mandate, the Liberals have left themselves vulnerable on the electorally all-important left. You can ensure that the battle for the progressive terrain over the next two years is a rich policy competition, not a contest between empty slogans and nice suits.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Beings of Trappist-1: Resolve to make room for us. Your planetary system, discovered by an international research team early last year, appears to be among the most Earth-like ever examined. Scientists say life may well exist on at least a few of your seven planets. After another overheated, super-storm-beset year here on Earth – one in which the global community took as many steps backward as forward on climate action - it seems we're pretty committed to destroying our own planet. Do you mind if we crash on one of yours? After all, you're only 39 light-years away. We can be there in 800,000 years!</p>\n",

The future of work In 2018 we will hear much more about computers and artificial intelligence replacing humans in the workplace.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The political rhetoric will shift from \"helping the middle class\" to the broader need for a new \"social contract\" and a guaranteed annual income to prevent worsening unemployment and income inequality.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The 2018 U.S. midterm elections will help to determine <b>Trump</b>'s fate. If the Republicans lose control of the Senate and Democrats reduce the GOP margin in the House there will be a much greater appetite to begin impeachment proceedings against <b>Trump</b>. <b>Trump</b>'s sub-40 per cent approval rating is a harbinger of widespread GOP losses.</p>\n",

Housing prices Governments in Canada need to slowly rein in and deflate housing prices in major centres across the country. The value of residential housing has grown so much in Canada that it is now much higher as a share of GDP (eight per cent) than it was in the United States at its peak (five per cent) before the housing sector there went bust. If housing prices continue to climb, our bubble will burst and be followed by a serious hit to consumer confidence, household equity and our economic growth. The state of democracy Across the Western world democracy seems under threat. Our market economy seems stronger and more dynamitic than our democratic institutions.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's to be expected that some tension will exist between governments that see it as easiest to exercise power without challenge, and the institutions - including media, opposition and citizens - which seek to hold them to account.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But it's worth pointing out how the balance between those forces continues to tilt in favour of the former - to the point where we've come to accept as normal a constant offensive against counterweights to power.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And we should be careful to note how that state of affairs is antithetical to the public interest in ensuring that governments work for us rather than themselves.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The most prominent current example of a political leader's hostility to counterbalances is of course Donald <b>Trump</b>'s treatment of the U.S. media.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> and his surrogates have branded as \"fake news\" true stories that happen to conflict with his interests and called for journalists to stop doing their job of holding government to account. <b>Trump</b> has gone beyond general institutional attacks to call for the harassment and firing of specific reporters when it has suited his purposes.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's leaders haven't been so blatant in trying to undermine the role of the press and of other forces that should hold them to account. But they also offer plenty of examples of the same phenomenon.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When caught using his office to push legislation which enriched him personally while threatening the retirement security of workers, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau responded by arguing that he shouldn't have to answer either to journalists or to the opposition.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott has taken to <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span> to attack reporters and columnists for offering reminders of the <b>Trudeau</b> government's neglect of <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</span> orders requiring fairness in child welfare funding.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's noteworthy that a government that makes a show of supporting reconciliation - including the calls to action of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission that highlighted the need to acknowledge the contribution of government policies to disparities in health and welfare - wants to base its position on the selective disappearance of history.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On a provincial level, the <span class=\"companylink\">Saskatchewan Party</span> has tried to shut down both media coverage and public investigation of the Global Transportation Hub scandal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">British Columbia Premier John Horgan has followed up a dubious decision to continue with his predecessor's Site C dam boondoggle by talking about his government's plans to set aside activism in favour of administration. (Contrast that to the oft-cited response of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to arguments for anti-discrimination legislation which faced political opposition: rather than minimizing the role of activism, he encouraged proponents of the plan to \"go out and make me do it.\") It's fair enough for governments to defend their positions, particularly when there's room to correct (or at least provide an alternative interpretation of) information coming from other sources.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But it's quite another to try to use the power of the state to undercut the fundamental role of journalists, opposition politicians and the general public in holding power to account.</p>\n",

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. </div>\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Who is the leader of the free world? Important as the question sounds, I’m beginning to wonder if it’s better left unanswered.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The U.S. president is no longer the obvious choice. Even the new U.S. National Security Strategy, filled with bombastic statements such as “the whole world is lifted by America’s renewal and the reemergence of American leadership,” acknowledges growing competition among powers. And of course “America first” is the slogan of a national, not a global, leader.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So who, if not Donald <b>Trump</b>, qualifies for the job? Let’s first consider its history.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The origin of the term “leader of the free world” is somewhat uncertain. Dominic Tierney of the Atlantic tracked it back to a 1948 <span class=\"companylink\">New York Times</span> article, in which British economist Barbara Ward called upon the U.S. to lead the West in fighting the communist threat. But a Google Books search suggests the title was first used during World War I and has made regular appearances in English-language books since the late 1930s. In any case, its use surged at the peak of the Cold War in the early 1960s (when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev began referring to “the free world” with heavy irony), declined toward the détente of the mid-1970s, then gained again through the Soviet Union’s collapse and up until its last peak in 2007, just before the global financial crisis.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Typically applied to the U.S. president, the title has acquired a bitterly ironic flavor since the election of <b>Trump</b>, who studies suggest is broadly mistrusted in democratic countries. As a result, some pundits have been discussing whether a more globally respected politician, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could take over the role. As recently as September, Hillary Clinton called her “the most important leader in the free world right now.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Merkel, however, probably doesn’t fit the bill. Weakened by the last election, she has found herself embroiled in the longest coalition talks in Germany’s post-World War II history. Even if she’s back on top by Easter, global leadership will be pretty far from her mind as she settles into what’s likely to be her last term in power. She doesn’t even have an obvious successor in her party. Besides, she has always shown much more interest in shaping the European Union to Germany’s benefit than in leading the world, free or otherwise.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Other European leaders don’t qualify, either. Almost all lead precarious, painstakingly built coalitions with domestically focused agendas, while others — mostly in Eastern Europe — aren’t interested in being part of any liberal order. The only notable exception is French President Emmanuel Macron, mockingly called “Jupiter” and compared to the Sun King by his compatriots. But, at 40 and in his first year as an elected official, he’s unproven. Also, France has been in the doldrums for too long and has too many institutional and economic problems to be a credible global leader.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Top EU officials could take a shot. The European project unites most established democracies, is the world’s biggest trade bloc and has a consistent track record of defending liberal values. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk, besides being something of a comical pair, have proven powerless even to bring the <span class=\"companylink\">EU</span> closer together. They’re negotiators and compromise makers, not leaders. And the <span class=\"companylink\">EU</span>, for all its economic power, is a peace project, so its role in resolving global conflicts will remain minimal.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">One could make a case for Canadian Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>. He’s a liberal favorite, branded “the free world’s best hope” by <span class=\"companylink\">Rolling Stone</span>. He acts the part, stressing his differences with <b>Trump</b> on immigration, climate change and gender equality. He has also boosted Canada’s military spending. But it wouldn’t be easy for Canada to emerge from the U.S. shadow, and <b>Trudeau</b> isn’t particularly popular with Canadians (his approval rating just slipped below 50 percent).</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There still is a free world, in which citizens elect political leaders rather than tolerate authoritarian succession like in China or Russia. It doesn’t, however, appear to have a credible leader — one who would be both powerful and committed to clear, attractive values.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Moreover, it’s hard to see where one would come from. The U.S. will be eyed with mistrust after <b>Trump</b>. Its values are in flux and hard for outsiders to understand, and its military power is not necessarily relevant to modern conflicts, as Europe’s Middle Eastern refugee crisis has demonstrated. Germany, for its part, is weighed down by its history and held together by a rebuilt communitarian tradition, in which leadership-hungry politicians are unlikely to flourish.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The question, then, is whether the free world needs a leader. Perhaps the path forward requires collective decisions and compromises, inclusiveness and consensus, negotiation and civilized debate. It sounds boring, even weak, and the outcomes may often appear suboptimal, but freedom and strong leadership have always been a little at odds. Quiet, soft power as practiced by European nations, Canada and Japan might work better as an advertisement for democracy than U.S. assertiveness has since the end of the Cold War.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The invitation list is limited. The guests of honour will be those few nations that opposed the resolution passed by the United Nations on Dec. 21. These include heavyweights such as Togo, the Marshall Islands, Nauru and Palau, Honduras, Guatemala and the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Out of seasonal generosity - or political desperation - Haley has also invited the 35 members who abstained and the 21 who were absent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada, full of merriment, will attend the party. We abstained but that was enough for an invitation.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Israel had little to do with our decision. It was about managing our most important relationship, with the United States, as we re-negotiate our most important economic covenant, the <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>.</p>\n",

Strange how it could make a vote in the General Assembly more about the United States than about the United Nations. Fundamentally, our vote was about keeping ourselves in the good graces of the Americans.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If the road to Washington runs through Jerusalem, we'll take it. Our challenging situation conjures up the usual clichés: threading the needle, walking a tightrope or, as one Liberal MP says pointedly, \"navigating a minefield.\" Everything we say and do these days is measured by how it is seen by Donald <b>Trump</b>. He prizes attention and loyalty; in refusing to oppose his stand on Israel, we want to remain in the emperor's favour.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">After all, <b>Trump</b> promises to exact retribution from countries that oppose his view on Jerusalem, a threat Ambassador Haley echoes. \"The United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in this Assembly,\" she declared, noting the U.S. is the leading financial contributor to the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> and sends aid to many of the nations that voted against it. The warning: \"Cross us, and you'll be sorry.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For Canada, the vote was realpolitik. Our longstanding policy is that the status of Jerusalem should be determined by Arabs and Israelis, as part of a peace agreement. It's why Canada's embassy remains in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem, where the U.S. is now planning to move its embassy to make a broader statement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the past we would have joined our allies - Britain, France Germany - in opposing <b>Trump</b>'s change of policy. But as long as <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> is under discussion, we have another priority. Since <b>Trump</b> became president and threatened to withdraw from <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, the supreme effort from Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, his ministers and our diplomats has been to save the agreement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This means doing nothing to antagonize <b>Trump</b>. It means flattering him. It even means creating a dubious bi-national women's business council chaired by Ivanka <b>Trump</b> when <b>Trudeau</b> visited the White House last March.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Most of all, it means speaking no ill of a president who never stops speaking. From the prime minister and everyone else, then, no sarcastic rejoinders, no cheeky tweets. It isn't easy to impose this kind of discipline across government, but the Liberals have. The point: Let nothing threaten the chances of an agreement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So, when this isolationist, nativist president acts or speaks against the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Iran nuclear agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, open immigration or North Korea, we remain mute. <b>Trump</b> may be listening. We just shut up.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This is surely hurting us at the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span>, where we're seeking a rotational seat on the Security Council in 2020; more abstentions like this one on Israel and our hopes will disappear. As long as <b>Trump</b> and trade dominate our foreign policy, we're in a dilemma.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada has made contributions in 2017 to addressing many of those global challenges; but that has not always been backed up with consistent action at home.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The list of countries devastated by conflict grows long. Entrenched crises continued in Syria, Iraq and South Sudan. Widespread ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people erupted in Burma, with hundreds of villages razed, untold numbers of people killed, and more than 600,000 refugees forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The crisis in Yemen deepened; the grim civilian toll exacerbated by a Saudi-led blockade that impedes humanitarian relief. The Palestinian people marked 50 years of human rights abuse under Israeli military occupation. And the lawlessness that has ravaged Libya finally made the front pages with reports of harrowing abuses against refugees and migrants, including slavery.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While countries, including Canada, pursue initiatives to provide aid, protect refugees and address the abuses, effective multilateral action is thwarted by geopolitics. There are no <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> arms embargoes against Syria, South Sudan, Yemen or Burma; all blocked by threatened Russian or Chinese vetoes.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Particularly troubling this year has been the rise of hate. While racism and bigotry are by no means new phenomena, the extent to which demonization has become part of mainstream politics is chilling. Those targeted are the most marginalized in society, including refugees and migrants, religious and ethnic minorities and the LGBTQ community.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This goes beyond Donald <b>Trump</b>'s White House. Vilification is government policy in Hungary, Russia, Turkey and the Philippines, to name a few, and surfaces with every western European election.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada has countered by promoting feminism, inclusion and diversity; a campaign that will need greater profile, new allies and more concrete initiatives over the coming year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Standing up for universal human rights has become perilous worldwide. Human rights defenders are regularly smeared, attacked, imprisoned and killed. They need Canada's support like never before, including defenders who highlight the impact of Canadian mining companies in their communities.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It has also been a busy year for human rights within Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The rhetoric of embracing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples may finally be backed up by law; with government support for Bill C-262, legislation sponsored by MP Romeo Saganash. Yet a commitment to the declaration's principles is clearly lacking when the federal and B.C. governments press ahead with the Site C dam despite First Nations opposition, or the <b>Trudeau</b> government fails to comply with <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</span> orders to end discrimination against First Nations children.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The long-awaited National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is proceeding but faces internal challenges and criticism from families and Indigenous leaders. Meanwhile, the government has not advanced measures that are already well-agreed, including more shelters for Indigenous women fleeing violence in remote communities.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Strong Canadian regard for women's human rights is admirable, particularly the new Feminist International Assistance Policy. Also welcome is a new federal strategy on gender-based violence, which now needs a national action plan bringing all levels of government together in tackling this serious human rights concern.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Last year, Canada enjoyed accolades for resettling more than 45,000 Syrian refugees and the government continues to champion refugee rights globally. But resettlement numbers diminished substantially in 2017. And a refusal to lift the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States forced refugees fleeing increasingly hostile U.S. policies to make unsafe, irregular journeys across the world's longest undefended border in order to pursue refugee claims in Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There are other disconcerting inconsistencies in Canada's positions. While contributing to humanitarian relief in Yemen, for instance, the sale of $15 billion worth of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition responsible for war crimes in the Yemen conflict, goes ahead. And while preparing to sign on to the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> Arms Trade Treaty, implementing legislation exempts arms deals with the United States, accounting for over half of all Canadian arms sales.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">When Islamic State marauders roared across Iraq's Nineveh Plains in July 2014, they burned the churches, desecrated shrines, toppled crosses and destroyed ancient manuscripts. About 200,000 Christians fled and most of them ended up in displaced persons camps in Iraqi Kurdistan or in makeshift refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. In Mosul, St. Paul's Cathedral remained standing, but it was turned into a jail.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In one of the few hopeful moments of 2017 - an otherwise brutal and dreary year - a Christmas Eve mass was celebrated for the first time in four years at St. Paul's. Local Muslims joined the Chaldean Catholic congregants in the service.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">By October, Iraqi and Kurdish forces, backed by a U.S.-led anti-ISIL coalition that included 850 Canadian Forces personnel, had routed the Islamic State from its last major strongholds in Iraq and Syria. Now Christians are beginning to trickle back to the ash heaps where their churches once stood. That's one useful thing the civilized world managed to accomplish in 2017. There's not much else to crow about.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Syria remains a nightmare of human desolation. With half the population displaced and the country's infrastructure destroyed, Vladimir Putin's Russia and Khomeinist Iran continue to arm and bankroll the criminal regime of Baathist mass-murderer Bashar Assad, who goes on dropping bombs on civilians while a peacetalks parody continues in Geneva.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The United Nations continues to prove its bloated uselessness, perhaps nowhere more obscenely than in Yemen, which is in the throes of the worst outbreak of cholera in human history: nearly one million people are now infected. Another eight million people are on the verge of starvation. More than 10,000 people have been killed by bullets and bombs in a Saudi-Khomeinist proxy war that erupted in Yemen two years ago and yet it took a tournament of backroom arm-twisting competitions in September just to get the <span class=\"companylink\">UN Human Rights Council</span> to agree to look into the disaster. Meanwhile, at the <span class=\"companylink\">UN General Assembly</span>, the thing everyone has been setting their hair on fire over lately is the <b>Trump</b> administration's pledge to make good on a Clinton-era promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, which just happens to be the capital of Israel.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " Xi Jinping's police state was marking the holidays in its own way in Beijing. On Boxing Day, the satirist Wu Gan, famous for his flamboyant street protests against corrupt officials and the Communist party's abuse of power, was sentenced to an eight-year jail term on charges of subversion. <span class=\"companylink\">Amnesty International</span> points out Beijing has established a tradition of sentencing human rights activists while observers are distracted by the holidays.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On Boxing Day last year, human rights champion Chen Yunfei was dragged before a court on charges of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" for organizing a memorial tribute to the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. On Christmas Day in 2009, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years for his part in composing a prodemocracy manifesto. Liu died in July of multiple organ failure due to a liver cancer prison authorities claimed they didn't know about until just weeks before he succumbed.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A low point in Canada's year on the \"world stage\" in 2017: at exactly the moment Liu died under heavy guard in a hospital in the northeast city of Shenyang, now-former governor general David Johnston was hamming it up and smiling for the cameras while shaking hands with Xi Jinping at a formal dinner in Beijing. Another low point: Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s obsequious pleadings for \"free trade\" favours during his visits in Beijing last month, tarted up in the usual pretty lies about \"strengthening the middle class\" and \"regular, frank dialogue on human rights issues like good governance, freedom of speech and the rule of law.\" Upbraided for his impudence, <b>Trudeau</b> was sent on his way.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Another one: in his address to the 72nd <span class=\"companylink\">UN General Assembly</span> in September, <b>Trudeau</b> said nothing about the crisis in Yemen or about China's increasingly totalitarian thuggery and its perfection of artificial-intelligence thought control and its persecution of Uyghur Muslims, Christians, feminists and human rights lawyers or about Myanmar's bloody ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people. Instead, <b>Trudeau</b> enumerated Canada's long and dismal history of trespasses upon the dignity and the rights of Canada's Indigenous Peoples. In another context, that would be all well and good. But the point of it at the <span class=\"companylink\">UN General Assembly</span> was to say nothing to cause any of the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span>'s 193 voting member states to take offence and fail to cast a vote for Canada in the contest for a useless non-voting chair around the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span>'s disgraced Security Council table for 2021-22.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It is in this fashion the liberal world order recedes into barbarism and imbecility.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Under President Donald <b>Trump</b>, the United States has abdicated any claim to global leadership. The field has been ceded to Putin, who closed the year by nullifying the candidacy of his primary electoral opponent Alexei Navalny, who was then immediately placed under investigation for proposing a boycott of the upcoming phoney March 18 elections. The torch has been passed to Xi, whose 2,280 lieutenants at October's Communist Party Congress affirmed his elaborate scheme to remake the world in his own image. The reins have been handed to Iran's lyncher-in-chief Hassan Rouhani, who openly gloats over the Obama administration's folly in surrendering the people of Syria to Iran in exchange for a nuclear deal that isn't worth the paper it's written on. And in exchange for remaining a nominal <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> \"ally,\" Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan is permitted to spend his time undisturbed as he jails journalists and opposition leaders, terrorizes Turkey's Kurds and lounges around his opulent presidential palace.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And what of the glorious Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela, which had declared Canada's chargé d'affaires persona non grata - owing to Canada properly sanctioning the Nicolas Maduro regime's officials - causing Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to similarly bar Venezuela's ambassador to Canada? Sitting on top of the world's largest proven oil reserves, Venezuelans are paying for their government's adventures in Chavismo by starving to death. The silver lining: this cannot last. Agony like this will only be endured for so long.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is some good news. The <span class=\"companylink\">European Union</span> is at last standing up to populist-nationalist Jaroslaw Kaczynski, telling him Poland can be an authoritarian basket case or it can be European, but not both. Germany is starting to talk back to China, warning Beijing its efforts to spy on politicians won't be tolerated. Australia is forging laws to keep Beijing's money and influence peddling out of Canberra's affairs. The U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China has started to notice Beijing's elaborate subversions. Even Nepal is starting to face off against China. So is Sri Lanka. Canada? Not even close.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, is throwing a party in January. Only those who opposed a resolution condemning her country for recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Israel are invited.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It will be a subdued affair. The invitation list is limited. The guests of honour will be those few nations that opposed the resolution passed by the United Nations on Dec. 21. These include heavyweights such as Togo, the Marshall Islands, Nauru and Palau, Honduras, Guatemala and the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Out of seasonal generosity - or political desperation - Haley has also invited the 35 members who abstained and the 21 who were absent, presumably with the diplomatic flu. The resolution passed 128-9.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada, full of merriment, will attend the party. We abstained, but that was enough for an invitation.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Israel had little to do with our decision. It was about managing our most important relationship, with the United States, as we re-negotiate our most important economic covenant, the <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\n",
       " <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>. Strange how it could make a vote in the General Assembly more about the United States than about the United Nations. Fundamentally, our vote was about keeping ourselves in the good graces of the Americans.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If the road to Washington runs through Jerusalem, we'll take it. Our challenging situation conjures up the usual clichés: threading the needle, walking a tightrope or, as one Liberal MP says pointedly, \"navigating a minefield.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Everything we say and do these days is measured by how it is seen by President Donald <b>Trump</b>. He prizes attention and loyalty; in refusing to oppose his stand on Israel, we want to remain in the emperor's favour.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">After all, <b>Trump</b> promises to exact retribution from countries that oppose his view on Jerusalem, a threat Ambassador Haley echoes. \"The United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in this assembly,\" she declared, noting the U.S. is the leading financial contributor to the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> and sends aid to many of the nations that voted against it. The warning: \"Cross us and you'll be sorry.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For Canada, the vote was realpolitik. Our long-standing policy is that the status of Jerusalem should be determined by Arabs and Israelis as part of a peace agreement. It's why Canada's embassy remains in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem, where the U.S. is now planning to move its embassy to make a broader statement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the past, we would have joined our allies - Britain, France and Germany - in opposing <b>Trump</b>'s change of policy. But as long as <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> is under discussion, we have another priority. Since <b>Trump</b> became president and threatened to withdraw from <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, our sole, supreme effort - from Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, his ministers and our diplomats - has been to save the agreement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This means doing nothing to antagonize <b>Trump</b>. It means flattering him. It even means creating a dubious bi-national women's business council chaired by Ivanka <b>Trump</b>, unveiled awkwardly when <b>Trudeau</b> visited the White House in March.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Most of all, it means speaking no ill of a president who never stops speaking. From the prime minister and everyone else, then, no sarcastic rejoinders, no cheeky tweets. It isn't easy to impose this kind of discipline across government, but the Liberals have. The point: let nothing threaten the chances of an agreement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So when this isolationist, nativist president acts or speaks against the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Iran nuclear agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, open immigration or North Korea, we remain mute. <b>Trump</b> may be listening. We just shut up.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This is surely hurting us at the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span>, where we're seeking a rotational seat on the Security Council in 2020; more abstentions like this one on Israel and our hopes will disappear. As long as <b>Trump</b> and trade dominate our foreign policy, we're in a dilemma.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The reward is a new free-trade agreement to sustain our prosperity. That's uncertain now. The risk is our independence and self-respect. That's priceless.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The pugilistic Donald <b>Trump</b> has persuaded some that he's fighting for the working class, but his presidency has shifted many onto a combat footing, leading to what some call \"the resistance.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The war between the sexes is also becoming harder to deny, with the #Metoo movement taking advantage of social media to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment. Casualties are mounting on all sides.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Chimpanzee specialist Jane Goodall originally reported her human-like African subjects were paragons of peace, but later admitted they were also adept at theft, kidnapping and warfare.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Aggression is often impossible to repress. And in many cases it shouldn't be.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So, if we're willing to admit we're capable of warlike behaviour, how shall we live? Should we become Warriors? There are dark aspects to the Warrior archetype, which justifiably make women and men nervous. We hear often about the downside of Warrior energy - the potential for unnecessary violence, the need to control or gain attention. But there are also good traits associated with it, like discipline and courage.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And, anyway, there's nothing to be proud of when the \"nice\" person most Canadians supposedly try to be actually turns out to be a pushover.</p>\n",

There's Wonder Woman, Brienne of Tarth on Game of Thrones, Lara Croft, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill, Sarah Connor from The Terminator and Xena the Warrior Princess.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Psychoanalyst Elizabeth Waugaman says, contrary to conventional associations of women with giving life, there is a hidden history of women in battle, ready to fight for their beliefs. They follow in the steps of ancient Greece's Amazons, the church's Joan of Arc, China's Fu Hao and Norse mythology's Valkyries.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The list of male Warriors in movies goes on and on: the Terminator, the Gladiator, the Seven Samurai, Superman, Wolverine, Jackie Chan, Mad Max, James Bond.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Like Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, a boxer, Singh is literally a fighter, a martial-arts specialist.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's defence minister, Harjit Sajjan, is both a soldier and adherent of the warrior tradition of the Khalsa, which means \"the Pure.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Without stretching a Christmas connection too far, it can be said the birth of Jesus Christ has at times been seen as an opportunity to revere a baby who would grow up to be a nonviolent battler for righteousness.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">New York University psychology professor Paul Vitz talks about how Jesus threw the moneylenders out of the temple and criticized the Pharisees. His apostle Paul would refer to his mission as \"spiritual warfare.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canadian Gerry Bowler, author of The Encyclopedia of Christmas, says there is a Nicaraguan revolutionary carol from the Sandinista years, \"which is famous for depicting the Holy Family as local peasants and the boy Jesus wanting to grow up to become a revolutionary freedom fighter.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There is no doubt Muhammad, founder of Islam, was a Warrior, a general. David, king of the Jews, led troops. Many Indigenous chiefs see themselves as Warriors, believing, \"Today is a good day to die.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In most cases, authentic Warriors adopt the qualities necessary to campaign for some just cause, however they understand it.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the classic book, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine, Michael Moore and Douglas Gillette explain the Warrior personality is brave and disciplined.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"A Warrior is always alert. He is always awake. He is never sleeping through life. He knows how to focus his mind and his body. He is what the samurai call 'mindful,'\" they say.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nevertheless, the authors remind us there can be a shadow to the Warrior. Inauthentic Warriors, say Moore and Gillette, have a violent emotional life. They can wreak havoc out of insecurity and self-loathing. Some can be sadistic. Today's socialjustice warriors, whether for the environment or against racism, can \"become what they hate,\" say the authors.</p>\n",

       " <div>1110 words</div><div>22 December 2017</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Early</div><div>N3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017 Calgary Herald </div>\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The number of times the phrase \"Canadian values\" has been uttered by Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>, his ministers, his government spokespeople and ministry press releases in the more than two years since the Liberals were elected is a number so high that, even if it could be counted, most of us probably couldn't wrap our head around the result. It's too vast for the human mind to comprehend, like the number of miles between Earth and Neptune or one of those obscure really high mathematical terms, like undecillion. That's a reliable sign that the term has become a coverup - a form of rhetorical white noise meant to dull the senses. What it's hiding is that the Liberals still can't figure out what \"Canadian values\" actually are.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"> That, on important questions - like whether Canada should, say, publicly condemn or not its most vital ally in the world over something like, oh, where that ally puts its own damn embassy in the territory of yet another vital and longstanding ally - the Liberal government abstains.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Liberal government cranked the volume on its white-noise machine Thursday as it tried calling back to those unspecified Canadian values to justify its lastminute decision to sit out the vote at the United Nations meant to censure the United States. This, over Washington's decision to finally make good on its promise, made by Congress 22 years ago, to move its embassy to Jerusalem. \"Canada's longstanding position is that the status of Jerusalem can be resolved only as part of a general settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute,\" said Adam Austin, a spokesman for Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland. But the vote wasn't about Canada's position on the status of Jerusalem; it was about Canada's position on whether the U.S. had a right to have its own position, which happens to align with Israel's position, on the status of Jerusalem. The Liberal government couldn't find any meaningful values to express on that.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The text of the resolution, brought before the <span class=\"companylink\">UN General Assembly</span> on Thursday in an emergency session, explicitly expresses \"deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem,\" referring to the <b>Trump</b> administration's decision, declares that any such decisions \"are null and void and must be rescinded,\" and \"Demands that all States comply\" with the resolution. Freeland's spokesman was at least willing to say the resolution was completely out of line: \"We are disappointed that this resolution is onesided and does not advance prospects for peace to which we aspire\"- we just weren't willing to say so in front of the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> - \"which is why we have abstained on today's vote.\" So the Liberals properly recognized an unjust resolution that works against peace ... and they took no stand.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Well, then, Canada's back, as the slogan goes, but it's to the era of undefined beliefs on the important questions in the world and passivity masked as honest-brokerism. Those can't rightly be called Canadian values, by any stretch - there are millions of Canadians who are unabashedly pro-American and pro-Israel and a solid number who are just as anti-American and anti-Israel - but refusing to be much of anything is the default position of Liberal governments. The problem today is, that without a firm framework of certain principles, Canada looks increasingly out of its depth and lost, muttering about its progressive values in a world where terribly regressive things are rapidly unfolding on the ground.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Earlier this week, the <b>Trump</b> administration released its new security policy. It was given much credit from geopolitics authorities for offering a pretty clear-eyed understanding that there are moves underway right now to realign the power structure of the world at a level we haven't seen since the demise of the Soviet Union. It identified China and Russia as rising \"revisionist powers\" actively trying to displace U.S. dominance in whatever regions they can. Meanwhile, Iran is acquiring strength, weaponry and power to dominate the Middle East, all while Islamist transnational groups infect new places each day with their terror, fear and political instability. The \"soft power\" theories of yesteryear's Liberals like Lloyd Axworthy were dubious even during the peace dividend years between the Cold War and 9/11, when stakes were lower. In their latest incarnation, with the Liberals shamelessly courting a dangerously unscrupulous China but uncomfortable expressing too much support for democratic Israel, the approach looks rather batty.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Say what you will about the <b>Trump</b> administration, but it has now taken a firm stand on more than one uncomfortable foreign policy issue. And with its decision on Jerusalem, and the pileon of <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> members that followed, managed at the same time to refresh all our memories as to what a lopsided, ludicrous parody the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> has become. Overwhelming support for the resolution was billed as a rebuke to the U.S. But it's one even Americans who don't much like <b>Trump</b> will probably take with some pride, particularly given the vote was accompanied by denunciations of U.S. and Israeli policies delivered by such noxious governments as Syria, Iran and Venezuela. The whole spectacle was orchestrated by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who declared in Istanbul two weeks ago that he would turn the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> into his weapon against the U.S. and Israel as a response to the Jerusalem decision. In that same speech, before an emergency summit of the Organization of Islamic Co-operation, Abbas also reportedly claimed Jews were \"faking and counterfeiting history and religion\" to establish a claim to Jerusalem, which he said properly belongs to Palestinians, not Jews.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nikki Haley, <b>Trump</b>'s UN ambassador, vowed Thursday that the U.S. would remember who voted against it. Given how badly Ottawa right now needs to keep relations running smoothly with Washington, let's hope <b>Trump</b> doesn't take issue with the Liberals' abstention. But Canadians certainly should. Six months ago, in a House of Commons speech widely applauded for finding clarity in the confusing time of <b>Trump</b>, Freeland promised that her government was ready to stand up for cherished western values if others would not. But defending our closest partner's sovereign right to place an embassy in the capital of an ally we both value - and in the face of bad-faith behaviour by Israel's antagonists - is one of the easy tests given everything else that's out there right now. And we skipped it.</p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It has been a particularly tough year for human rights, marked by violent turmoil and hate-filled divisiveness around the world.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada has made contributions in 2017 to addressing many of those global challenges; but that has not always been backed up with consistent action at home.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The list of countries devastated by conflict grows long. Entrenched crises continued in Syria, Iraq and South Sudan. Widespread ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people erupted in Myanmar, with hundreds of villages razed, untold numbers of people killed, and over 600,000 refugees forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The crisis in Yemen deepened; the grim civilian toll exacerbated by a Saudi-led blockade that impedes humanitarian relief. The Palestinian people marked 50 years of human rights abuse under Israeli military occupation. And the lawlessness that has ravaged Libya finally made the front pages with reports of harrowing abuses against refugees and migrants, including slavery.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While countries, including Canada, pursue initiatives to provide aid, protect refugees and address the abuses, effective multilateral action is thwarted by geopolitics. There are no <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> arms embargoes against Syria, South Sudan, Yemen or Myanmar; all blocked by threatened Russian or Chinese vetoes.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Particularly troubling this year has been the rise of hate. While racism and bigotry are by no means new phenomena, the extent to which demonization has become part of mainstream politics is chilling. Those targeted are the most marginalized in society, including refugees and migrants, religious and ethnic minorities and the LGBTQ community.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This goes beyond Donald <b>Trump</b>'s White House. Vilification is government policy in Hungary, Russia, Turkey and the Philippines, to name a few; and surfaces with every Western European election.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada has countered by promoting feminism, inclusion and diversity; a campaign that will need greater profile, new allies and more concrete initiatives over the coming year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Standing up for universal human rights has become perilous worldwide. Human rights defenders are regularly smeared, attacked, imprisoned and killed. They need Canada's support like never before, including defenders who highlight the impact of Canadian mining companies in their communities.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It has also been a busy year for human rights within Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The rhetoric of embracing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples may finally be backed up by law; with government support for Bill C-262, legislation sponsored by MP Romeo Saganash. Yet a commitment to the declaration's principles is clearly lacking when the federal and B.C. governments press ahead with the Site C dam despite First Nations opposition, or the <b>Trudeau</b> government fails to comply with <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</span> orders to end discrimination against First Nations children.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The long-awaited National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is proceeding but faces internal challenges and criticism from families and Indigenous leaders. Meanwhile, the government has not advanced measures that are already well-agreed, including more shelters for Indigenous women fleeing violence in remote communities.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Strong Canadian regard for women's human rights is admirable, particularly the new Feminist International Assistance Policy. Also welcome is a new federal strategy on gender-based violence, which now needs a national action plan bringing all levels of government together in tackling this serious human rights concern.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Last year, Canada enjoyed accolades for resettling over 45,000 Syrian refugees and the government continues to champion refugee rights globally. But resettlement numbers diminished substantially in 2017. And a refusal to lift the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States forced refugees fleeing increasingly hostile U.S. policies to make unsafe, irregular journeys across the world's longest undefended border in order to pursue refugee claims in Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There are other disconcerting inconsistencies in Canada's positions. While contributing to humanitarian relief in Yemen, for instance, the sale of $15 billion worth of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition responsible for war crimes in the Yemen conflict, goes ahead. And while preparing to sign on to the <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> Arms Trade Treaty, implementing legislation exempts arms deals with the United States, accounting for over half of all Canadian arms sales.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Looking to 2018, as Canada hosts the G7, ramps up campaigning for a <span class=\"companylink\">UN Security Council</span> seat in 2020 and readies, with the rest of the world, for the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this must become a brighter year, devoted to shoring up human rights.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Hard as it is for true patriots to admit, the big, Canada Day bash in the capital was a disaster — from massive security lines to the steady rain that turned <span class=\"companylink\">Parliament</span>'s lawn into a muddy swamp.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Letters to the federal Heritage department, released earlier this year under an access-to-information request, told the sad tale of regretful partygoers.[http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/maybe-youll-handle-the-200th-better-the-reviews-are-in-for-canada-day-on-the-hill-and-theyre-brutal] “Shameful fiasco” and “embarrassment” were among the scathing reviews.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The mud on the lawn is long gone, replaced by a Canada 150 skating rink that will be sitting directly in front of Centre Block through the holidays and well into the New Year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This birthday project has also been criticized, for its $5.6-million cost and for the ultra-bureaucratic rules around its use — including the need to make reservations before taking a turn on the ice.[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/23/canada-150-rink-to-stay-open-till-end-of-february-minister-says-but-still-no-hockey.html]\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But some of those rules are a direct result of the Canada Day fiasco, according to Andrew Campbell, head of the Canada 150 secretariat in the federal government.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“One of the things that we do is try and learn from different activities we had,” Campbell told a <span class=\"companylink\">CBC Radio</span> call-in show recently. “That in fact is why we are having the reservation system.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">As it turns out, then, these two, signature moments of Canada 150 celebrations, taking place right on Parliament Hill, are a pretty good metaphor for the year in politics.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s government, it's been a year of lessons in the peril of high expectations and learning from large mistakes. The “sunny ways” of the early days in office have definitely run into more unsettled conditions: rainstorms and ice in 2017. Fittingly, the year even ended with a rebuke from the ethics counsellor for the PM's trip to the Aga Khan's island last Christmas — another reminder for <b>Trudeau</b> in 2017 that sunny conditions come with a price.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Canada Day fiasco was not the only thing that went wrong this summer for the government, either. Early in July, news emerged of a $10-million settlement for Omar Khadr, the former child soldier and prisoner at Guantanamo.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Even as the outrage over Khadr was still simmering, Finance Minister Bill Morneau released proposals to crack down on taxes for private corporations in Canada, which turned out to be only the beginning of his troubles this year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Hammered by ethics controversies, elbowed aside (almost literally) by the Prime Minister at a news conference in Stouffville, Ont., Morneau probably felt a lot like the Canada Day partygoers for a lot of this year — knee-deep in mud, hoping for the rain to stop falling.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">By the end of the year, though, Morneau had backed down on many of the controversial tax proposals, sold all his shares in his old company, Morneau Shepell, and was admitting to journalists that 2017 had handed him some strong lessons.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">“I've learned from this experience that we have to be very good at communicating to Canadians what it is that we're trying to achieve,” Morneau said in an interview with Canadian Press,[http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/morneau-2017-business-newsmaker-1.4453293] after being named CP's Business Newsmaker of the Year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Other <b>Trudeau</b> ministers were weathering some severe storms too this year. The Phoenix payroll system catastrophe, affecting the wages of tens of thousands of public servants, was passed mid-year to Public Services Minister Carla Qualtrough, whose main job now seems to be lowering expectations on how soon the problems can be fixed.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Problems with the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) have prompted questions about whether <b>Trudeau</b> was politically wise to raise hopes so high for reconciliation with Indigenous people.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And of course, Donald <b>Trump</b>'s first year in power has forced a total reset of the <b>Trudeau</b> government's expectations on the Canada-U.S. front, including the realization that the <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> is headed for failure, not a hoped-for “progressive” update.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There's an old saying in politics — that's it always better to underpromise and over-deliver than do the reverse. <b>Trudeau</b> and his government never seemed to embrace that advice, preferring to talk in lofty, idealistic terms about what “sunny ways” could accomplish.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On that score, Canada's 150th birthday party was a course correction for the federal Liberal government; a lesson that big plans and big parties — even sunny vacations — can turn into a mess when the rain starts to fall.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In that case, the best you can do is learn some lessons, lower some expectations and hope for things to freeze over so you can skate on Parliament Hill. Watch for <b>Trudeau</b>'s government to be a little more modest about what it can accomplish in 2018 — fewer promises of sunshine and a lot more skating.</p>\n",

He will preside over the New York City subway system, which is in terrible shape after decades of New York state government neglecting municipal repairs. Provincial Conservatives are making noises about taking over the TTC, and Toronto is an international laughingstock for its $3.35-billion one-stop Scarborough subway.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I'm writing after reading Anthony Furey's column on <b>Trudeau</b>'s <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> speech where Furey professed his preference for the diplomacy of <b>Trump</b> over our Prime Minister's chosen words. I take umbrage with his analysis which is off the mark.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Furey states <b>Trudeau</b> wasted the time of international diplomats by discussing Canadian problems. He further suggests it set us back diplomatically by revealing we have these problems, we're giving the \"bad guys\" something to use against us.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The thing is, every time we bring up human rights issues in other countries, they bring up our treatment of Indigenous peoples (and rightly so). By talking about the problem, <b>Trudeau</b> is showing how seriously he takes this issue. I can hear the other side already, \"But those are just words, what about action?\" The first step in correcting a problem is recognizing that you have one.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The best way to lead is by example. How many countries around the world have populations underserved, discriminated against? I'd say, most. <b>Trudeau</b> might've been discussing Canadian issues, but which attendees could not look within to their own policies? <b>Trudeau</b> was setting an example.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Furey prefers the offensive stance <b>Trump</b> took to the defensive nature of <b>Trudeau</b>'s speech. That the world has far more problems than some pesky issue we have with our Indigenous Peoples. Really? I think most of the world's problems could be boiled down to how we treat others. (I know, simplistic, but maybe some of the simple answers are the best ones).</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The activist in question wanted to know, understandably, why Harper (who was, at that moment, wearing a hairband adorned with fuzzy cat ears) appeared more concerned with the welfare of stray felines than she did with the arguably far more pressing crisis of Canada's missing and murdered Indigenous women[https://www.thestar.com/news/murdered-missing-indigenous-women.html].

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This week, after Steve Ecklund, the Alberta-based host of the outdoor TV show The Edge, posted a photo of himself to social media beaming behind a humongous dead cougar[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/12/21/laureen-harper-among-chorus-of-online-criticism-after-canadian-tv-host-kills-cougar-in-alberta.html], an animal he shot and killed in order to “stir fry” it later, as Harper shot back at the hunter on <span class=\"companylink\">Twitter</span>. “What a creep,” she wrote. “Chasing a cougar with dogs until they are exhausted then shooting a scared, cornered and tired animal. Must be compensating for something, small penis probably.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Wow. Laureen. Is it really you?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Apparently it is. “Wasn't hacked,” Harper tweeted after many wondered if an impostor had taken over her social media accounts. “I was really angry that some guy flies all the way to Alberta to kill a magnificent cougar, so he can make a stir fry.” All right. You go, girl.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Whatever your feelings about animal rights activism or cougar stir fry (a dish, I admit, I had never heard of until this week), it's pretty hard not to take pleasure in a moment like this, when a previously guarded and seemingly square public figure removes herself from the rigid cocoon of government life to reveal that she is, in fact, a real person with a dirty mind and a sense of humour. This kind of thing doesn't happen every day but when it does — when a former prime minister's wife makes a joke about an arrogant man's shortcomings, you have to laugh.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But more to the point, you have to ask: Why is it that in Canada, politicians and their spouses must exit the spotlight of public office before they can assume a voice that isn't totally stilted? Political Twitter and <span class=\"companylink\">Facebook</span> accounts in this country are endless streams of pancake breakfast photo-ops and salutations — in English and French, respectively — to various religious and community groups. God forbid a leader or their spouse should indicate that they have any semblance of a life outside work that doesn't involve reading Margaret Atwood in a Muskoka chair and watching the Junos on TV.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">To be fair, federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's tweet reads like it belongs to a real human being. The proudly geeky politician recently shared a photo of a sci-fi poster given to him for Christmas by his co-workers — a “Starship Size Comparison Chart” — alongside a tweet directed to his wife: “Now to frame it and ask Jill: living room or dining room?” (My guess is she said basement.)</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Of course, penis jokes à la Laureen Harper's this week are decidedly unparliamentary, verging on <b>Trump</b>-ian. But it would be nice if Canadian leaders could try for a happy medium in their personal communication style. A voice somewhere between, “Tonight we're here for homeless cats” and “Must be compensating for something, small penis, probably.” Personally, if I had to pick between the two, I'd take the latter.</p>\n",

Herewith my own exclusive interview with the prime minister, minus the prime minister.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Prime Minister, thank you for this. Might I just start with the news of the day? With regard to your holidays on the Aga Khan's private island in the Caribbean, you've been found by the ethics commissioner to have broken the conflict of interest law in four places. Yet you face no penalties of any kind. You've said the decision should give Canadians confidence in the process. Why? You claim you accepted his hospitality because he was a \"close family friend.\" Yet the ethics commissioner found you hadn't seen him in 30 years, but for a hug at your father's funeral. She seems quite clear the Aga Khan's interest in you had more to do with your official position and his dealings with the government you lead. If she could see that, why couldn't you? While we are on the subject of conflicts of interest, you've defended your finance minister, Bill Morneau, in the matter of his ownership, through a numbered company, of shares in his family's pension management firm, which stood to benefit from changes to pension rules he introduced. Your defence is that he worked with the ethics commissioner and followed her advice. Why didn't you? The revelation that Morneau, rather than divest the shares as required, kept them inside a private corporation, where he would pay less tax on them, came just as your government was proposing to crack down on people who set up private corporations to avoid tax - though not in ways that would affect him. Or you, for that matter, notwithstanding your own use of private corporations. Did it not occur to you this might look a bit, I don't know, two-faced? Or did you think no one would notice? The opposition is demanding Morneau disclose what else he holds inside his numbered companies. Will he? Will you? More broadly, how does your affinity for private fundraisers with Chinese billionaires and private island holidays with other billionaires, not to say your own wealth, square with your professed devotion to the interests and concerns of the middle class? Talking of billionaires, you've set great stock in developing a warm personal relationship with U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b>, notwithstanding your many political differences. You went so far as to participate in a photoop showcasing the president's commitment to women in business, even as he was accused of having sexually assaulted a number of women. A senior adviser, meanwhile, claimed to be kindred spirits with Steve Bannon. Leaving aside questions of taste, what is the evidence this campaign has paid off? Negotiations on \"updating\" <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> seem to be going nowhere. What is your plan B in the event the talks collapse altogether? How does your failure to secure alternative trade arrangements, with either the Trans-Pacific Partnership or China, fit with that? The China initiative foundered on your attempt to impose upon China the latest Liberal party orthodoxy in matters of gender rights and the environment. Yet you seem less concerned about China's predations on our soil - greenlighting Chinese takeovers of Canadian firms without proper security reviews, even signalling a willingness to discuss an extradition treaty. Just what is your bottom line when it comes to trade with China? The U.S. has just slashed its effective corporate tax rate almost in half, among other significant changes that experts say eliminates our competitive advantage. How will you respond? Is it time for fundamental tax reform? If you had to do it all over, would you still have kicked those Liberal senators out of caucus? With regard to defence, the platform promised two, mutually incompatible things: that you would hold an \"open and transparent\" competition to replace the fleet of CF-18 fighter jets, and that you would not choose the F-35. Which of those is still operative? Cancelling a plan to buy <span class=\"companylink\">Boeing</span> planes as a stopgap, you said you would not do business with companies that were \"suing us,\" by which you meant <span class=\"companylink\">Boeing</span>'s complaint before the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. International Trade Commission</span> with regard to Bombardier's C-Series passenger jet. How is the C-Series, now majority-owned by <span class=\"companylink\">Airbus</span> and to be assembled in Alabama, \"us\"? The fall economic statement showed revenues for the current fiscal year at almost exactly the level projected in the Conservatives'last budget. Yet instead of a small surplus, as the Conservatives had it, the government is running a deficit of roughly $20 billion. In the past you've blamed the Tories for the deficit, but it's pretty clear now it's your own work, isn't it? Your government has broken several important promises from the platform on which you campaigned in the past election, notably on electoral reform and balanced budgets. No doubt you will make new promises in the next election campaign. Why should Canadians believe you would be any more likely to keep them?</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">By abstaining, we did not support <b>Trump</b>, nor did we poke him, but, of course, Washington immediately spun the results to indicate those who had abstained had backed them.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Even Ottawa in bleak mid-winter must have been a nice break for Rex Tillerson, the U.S. Secretary of State.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">At least no one here asked him if he had submitted a letter of resignation, as happened the day before when he held a media availability with the French foreign minister.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Tillerson and Canada's global affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, presented a united front on issues ranging from North Korea to the <span class=\"companylink\">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> in an early evening news conference. But that only goes to show how far out of Donald <b>Trump</b>'s orbit the Secretary of State is.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He dismissed talk of resignation as \"ridiculous\" on Monday, but he and the President apparently don't see eye to eye on a range of issues - hence the rumours that he's about to be fired.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If the Canada-U.S. relationship was dependent on Tillerson, it would be on much firmer ground than it is. He talked of co-hosting a meeting of foreign ministers in Vancouver in mid-January on the North Korea crisis as a means of increasing the pressure on the Hermit Kingdom to come to the negotiating table.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Freeland said solidarity is important to demonstrate that the Vancouver Group countries - the original combatants in the Korean conflict, plus countries like India, Japan and Sweden - view North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons as a \"threat to our shared security\".</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"The pressure campaign will not abate and it will remain in place until they give up nuclear weapons and verify they have done so,\" said Tillerson.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">On this issue at least, there is common ground - at least as long as diplomatic options remain open.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But for all Tillerson's talk about negotiating a modernized <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> that is \"fair to both sides,\" there is a gaping chasm between the world views of the two governments that no amount of diplomatic charm can bridge.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">You could not find two more contrasting foreign policy strategies than the one laid out by <b>Trump</b> on Monday, and that outlined by Freeland in the House of Commons last May.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trump</b> sees foreign policy as a game that America will win by investing more on nuclear weapons and the military. Climate change and trade deals have been dropped as national security concerns. Peace would be advanced through strength; prosperity guaranteed by turning inward.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Freeland, on the other hand, explicitly rejected a \"Canada First\" approach, outlining \"shared menaces\" like climate change and natural disasters that require an international order based on rules to combat - \"one in which might is not always right; one in which more powerful countries are constrained in their treatment of smaller ones by standards that are internationally respected, enforced and upheld\".</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"Canada must set our own clear and sovereign course,\" she said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But, as the present prime minister's father observed so perceptively, our sovereignty is compromised by every twitch and grunt the elephant next door makes.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The longer <b>Trump</b> is in power, the dissonance between his Administration and Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s government becomes less theoretical.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We cannot ignore what <b>Trump</b> does - the latest example is what academic Jack Mintz called the \"tax tsunami\" about to crash into the global economy, as the U.S. passes the most extensive tax package in 30 years.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <b>Trudeau</b> government will be forced to respond to lower corporate tax rates and new rates on investment, if jobs and profits start flowing south.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Tillerson said he is \"supportive of a positive outcome\" on <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> but it is not his file, and even if it were, his opinion likely carries little weight in the White House after he allegedly referred to the President as a \"f--ing moron.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The bottom line is that Canada is trying to negotiate a trade deal with a protectionist president. The <b>Trudeau</b> government has drawn a number of red lines beyond which it says it will not cross; it has hitched itself to Mexico; and, it is pushing an agenda on \"progressive\" priorities like climate, labour and gender that are an anathema to the President.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">If the <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian government</span> really wants to strike a deal on <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>, it may have to accept one where Canada benefits less.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's nice that the global affairs minister is on first name terms with her American counterpart.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But Tillerson is probably not buying green bananas for the office fruit-bowl.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The man setting the tone for the Canada-U.S. relationship is fulminating in front of Fox News - and the Prime Minister is further away from a meeting of minds with him than he has ever been.</p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The customarily calm David MacNaughton, our Canadian ambassador in Trumpland, couldn't hide his irritation.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Following a trade commission hearing on the American bid to put astronomical tariffs on the sale of Canadian-made Bombardier jetliners, he met with reporters. “The whole thing\" he alleged, “is quite absurd.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Illogical for starters, he noted, is rival Boeing's principal grievance, it being that Ottawa heavily subsidizes Bombardier. As if, Mr. MacNaughton pointed out, Washington doesn't subsidize <span class=\"companylink\">Boeing</span> – to the tune of billions. Hypocrisy anyone?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But the low-key envoy wasn't only in high dudgeon about aircraft. On a broader canvas is the collateral damage brought on by the protectionist mentality at the White House. The anti-trade rhetoric “has given U.S. companies the permission to take action they wouldn't have taken before,\" he said, <span class=\"companylink\">Boeing</span> being just one case in point.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In dealing with the <b>Trump</b> administration, it's been a year of frustration for Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> and his cast. Try as they might – and they've put up a rational fight – they haven't been heard. The foremost example has been the Republican administration's threat to abandon the continental free-trade pact. It's still in play, in a Sword of Damocles sort of way.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">U.S. presidents, it need be said, don't owe Canada anything. They have their own interests to tend to, as Donald <b>Trump</b> has amply demonstrated.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Where Ottawa's exasperation lies is in trying to locate where, on any given day of the week, Mr. <b>Trump</b>'s head is situated. The North American free-trade agreement zigzags offer an example.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In his election campaign, Mr. <b>Trump</b> said <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> was the worst deal ever. Sorry folks, it's gone. But once elected, he had an abrupt change of mind. In March, he said that in the case of Canada it only needed tweaking.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In April, he had an abrupt change of mind. He let it be known that he was about to issue a termination notice of the treaty.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But he held off. Then in the summer came a change of mind. Phone transcripts of a call to the Mexican leader revealed Mr. <b>Trump</b> saying he had no problems with Canada on <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But in the fall came a change of mind.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">His negotiating team put forward five bombshell demands on <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> changes that are virtually impossible for Ottawa to meet.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Frustration anyone? How is the Prime Minister supposed to deal with a President whose modus operandi is the hairpin turn?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> threat has been one of several difficult consequences for Canada of Mr. <b>Trump</b>'s startling election triumph.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Another has been Ottawa's big hike in defence spending. With Mr. <b>Trump</b>, the <b>Trudeau</b> government decided, perhaps precipitously, that Canada could no longer rely on American protective power and the type of collective security presidents formerly embraced. Up went arms spending.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Another consequence was Mr. <b>Trump</b>'s killing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. It was a gift to China. It left the Ottawa Liberals scrambling for new deals and occasioned the recent unsuccessful <b>Trudeau</b> mission to the Middle Kingdom to curry commercial favour.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Another has been the American withdrawal from the Paris climate accord which Ottawa strongly supported. It has a stake in Washington's work on the environment.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Under Scott Pruitt, the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</span> is being turned into its opposite.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">An unwelcome development also is the Republicans' sweeping tax-cut package.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada held an advantage over the United States in luring investment by virtue of its very low 20-per-cent corporate tax rate. The American rate was in the 30s. The <b>Trump</b> package slices it to 21 per cent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's not all bad. The Keystone XL pipeline favoured by Mr. <b>Trudeau</b> was given the go ahead. On the foreign front, while there's been a lot of bellicose White House rhetoric, it's been a year of relative peace. On the issue of branding, the heavily scorned, morally challenged, inwardly looking <b>Trump</b> regime has served to enhance the image of Canada as a forward-thinking, fair-minded, open society.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A big plus for Canada is the high-flying economy over which Mr. <b>Trump</b> presides, making American markets for the northern neighbour more bounteous.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But that prompts yet more frustration in our country's capital. The Canadian and American economies are finally coming out of a long stretch of low-growth doldrums.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Things are looking up. Why jeopardize this, as the Canadian ambassador puts it, by moving to a new era of protectionism?</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">CORRECTION: Dominic Barton is the global managing partner of global management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company. A Dec. 17 opinion column on cheers and jeers for 2017 mistakenly referred to him as the former head of McKinsey. (December 20, 2017. Page A2)</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Most underrated politician of 2017</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Gooch: Premier Kathleen Wynne. At this moment Wynne is working with a personal approval rating below 20 per cent. It doesn't get any more underrated than that. I remember arriving at the Ontario Liberal Party leadership convention in 2013 as a Sandra Pupatello delegate. Being from Windsor, Pupatello was my introduction to strong women advocates in Canadian politics. I came prepared with buttons that read \"Congratulations Madame Premier.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It was thrilling to stand on the Maple Leaf Gardens floor knowing that our two strongest candidates were women, and no matter the outcome of the convention, we were going to make history by selecting Ontario's first woman as Premier. Wynne subsequently united the party, ran a successful campaign in 2014 and went to work delivering on the vision she laid out for the province, which she clearly communicated through public mandate letters with her ministers.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She made time in 2017 to travel the province, braving difficult conversations with Ontarians at town hall events. I've only known Wynne to be a principled and sincere leader. She is a titan in Canadian politics. As underrated as she is at the close of this year, I think we will see her catch her stride campaigning in 2018.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Sears: Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs. Completing her second year in the suicide chair of any cabinet, Bennett gets too little credit for the achievements of the <b>Trudeau</b> government in building a genuine program of reconciliation with Canada's Indigenous peoples. It is always tempting to mutter dismissively, \"Problems everywhere still!\" instead of marking what progress has been made. More agreements have been signed, more stupid anti-First Nations legal actions by the federal government cancelled, and more money flowed for First Nations health and education than in any time past. The naming of an impressively strong National Reconciliation Council last week, caps a year of real progress.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Not so good: the Missing and Murdered Inquiry remains wobbly, and a reset button may yet need to be hit.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Watt: B.C. Premier John Horgan brought the New Democratic Party back to power in the province for the first time since 2001. Horgan did an impressive job fighting former premier Christy Clark, a formidable politician, to a draw in the most recent election. Then he adeptly formed a coalition with the Green Party, while conceding little of his party's agenda.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In government, Horgan has so far proven to be similarly adept. The Green Party has bent to his will on a number of issues, and the Liberals have not found areas of weakness on which to attack his government. Horgan is quietly effective, and he promises to be an important player on the national scene, even as the federal NDP struggles.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Most overrated politician of 2017</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Gooch: Federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. One of my favourite quotes to apply to political organization is, \"The only reward for good work is more work.\" Singh ran a fantastic leadership campaign in 2017. So good, that the bar is raised for how he delivers on his promise to grow NDP membership to build a strong campaign in 2019. Examining his record as a former member of provincial parliament in Ontario, aside from a friendly personal demeanour, I have difficulty understanding the fanfare.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I think it's a mistake for Singh to prolong finding a seat in the House. The freedom to travel Canada and build his following is attractive, but the longer he waits, the more action he misses in Ottawa. He has amassed a loyal and passionate following over the course of 2017, an army of excellent organizers for the issues they care about. But retweets don't equal votes. Singh's next challenge is harnessing that energy to build and unite his party over the next two years.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Sears: Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre: Every <span class=\"companylink\">Parliament</span> produces at least one young blowhard politician, who is always loud, always certain, and frequently wrong. They usually grow up or get prematurely retired. In this case, surprisingly, the learning curve has been virtually flat over a decade and he has survived.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Poilievre is a good stuntman always ready with an angry sound bite, so he usually wins showdowns with less adept or self-promotional opponents. He has toned down his rent-a-rant in Opposition, and sometimes appears to be trying to demonstrate some gravitas. This year, though, he hit a new low this with his harassment and character attacks on Bill Morneau. Morneau's missteps, misjudgments and simply bad decisions have been painful to watch. Attacking the man's character and personal integrity came to close to <b>Trump</b>-style smears for even some of his own caucus colleagues.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Watt: Manitoba NDP Leader Wab Kinew has not demonstrated nearly the same proficiency as Horgan. A darling of left-wing activists in the West and something of a media star before entering politics, Kinew was elected leader of the Manitoba NDP in September, following the party's crushing election defeat by the PCs. Kinew was expected to be the kind of exciting leader the party needed to revive itself. Instead, he has faced a number of issues that have undermined confidence in his abilities. Soon after his election, it emerged that he had been charged both with domestic assault and drunk driving, throwing the NDP off-kilter. His ham-fisted response included denial and silence before he acknowledged the challenges. The NDP under his leadership has continued to struggle to find its footing.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The best political play of the year</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Gooch: Montreal mayoral race. Nobody expected it and she was told it couldn't be done. Yet, Valérie Plante stands today as the mayor of Montreal. She is the first woman in the 375-year history of the municipality to hold the post. It was a stunning upset, and she proved the benefit of a strong ground game by securing 51 per cent of the vote. Going up against an incumbent is an uphill battle that I'm sure most political veterans advised against. But she came with energy, determination, and a plan that Montreal voters connected with.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Sears: The Barton Panel. The <b>Trudeau</b> government's decision to name a high-level, blue-ribbon panel of federal economic advisers is neither novel nor often of much political value beyond announcement day. The difference this time was, first, the creative choice of panel head in Dominic Barton - among the most respected management consultants in the world, and the former head of McKinsey - and in the creative selection of panel members.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Even more impressive has been the way in which the panel has performed: issuing its work in carefully calibrated chunks, ensuring they have been politically battle-tested, and consulting a wide range of stakeholders, before release. And crucially, defending its sometimes surprisingly bold proposals without simply appearing to be paid government sycophants.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Watt: Hands down, former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney's impressive moves over the last year have been fascinating to watch. Kenney, seeing potentially years of being in opposition at the federal level, resigned his seat in the House of Commons to run for the leadership of the Alberta Progressive Conservatives, a party that was a spent force in the province. Kenney ran with the express promise to pack up the party and merge it with the upstart, right-wing Wildrose party to offer a united conservative alternative to Rachel Notley's NDP government.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Many were skeptical that the Ottawa-centric Kenney would have enough credibility to take over a party that had previously been resistant to a merger. But Kenney won the leadership resoundingly, and forced a merger. Following the merger, many speculated he would not be able to take the leadership of the United Conservative Party as easily, but he did. Kenney has won two leaderships in the last year and has united a fractured conservative movement. In doing so, he has become the favourite to become premier of Alberta following the 2019 general election.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The worst political play of the year</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Gooch: Quebec Niqab Ban. The passing of Bill 62, a law that made it illegal for public services in the province of Quebec to be received by people wearing face coverings was a sad moment in Canadian politics. It was alarming to see a <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian government</span> targeting a small group of already marginalized women by refusing much needed services. This dangerous political move played on a popular and misguided fear and hatred among Quebecers. This is a time when we need to be combating Islamophobia, not further entrenching it in Canadian policy. I was disappointed to see so few federal representatives speaking out passionately against it, including the prime minister.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Sears: Tax \"reform.\" If you want to survive one of the most risky ventures in politics - messing with the tax system - you better remember three things: keep it simple, bulletproof your political narrative for change, and ensure you have at least some of those most likely to be impacted by the changes on board in advance. The <b>Trudeau</b> government failed on all three in its badly botched summer tax 'reform' campaign.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The changes were impossible for any reasonable person to understand, were defended by attacking tax 'cheaters' among farmers, doctors and hair salon owners, and thus successfully incited a broad counterattack. A stunning self-inflicted wound.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Watt: Justice Richard Wagner, recently appointed chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, made a major error this summer when he declined the applications of four LGBTQ advocacy groups for intervener status in a case against the law school at Trinity Western University, a private Christian school in B.C. The case stems from the fact that Trinity Western requires students to sign a code of conduct limiting sexual intimacy to heterosexual marriage, a stance many LGBTQ groups find egregious and a reason to deny Trinity Western status as an accredited law school in Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Wagner, who said that LGBTQ groups were adequately represented in the case, declined to allow them as intervenors, leading to a broad outcry on social media. The decision was later reversed by then-Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Wagner was jockeying at the time to be named Supreme Court Chief Justice and the issue played badly with a socially conscious government. In spite of his later success in being named as Chief Justice, Wagner's decision was ill-made.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The most likely to shine in 2018</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Gooch: Black women in politics. In 2018, expect to see more Black women running, organizing and engaging in Canadian politics. Canada will be better for it, and political parties will be smart to empower and trust these women as they bring their talents to the political sphere. One race worth watching will be Leisa Washington in Whitby. The political rookie was just nominated as the Liberal candidate to go up against PC incumbent Lorne Coe.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"Men didn't want to work with me at first. They were afraid of the unknown. 'Will she outshine me?' \" Washington shared, in describing her work as a trail-blazing WNBA and NBA sports agent. She has a tough race ahead of her, but she seems up for the challenge. I look forward to seeing Washington and more Black Canadian women shining in political spaces in 2018.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Sears: Jagmeet Singh. As several pundits observed in predicting his victory at the close of the underwhelming NDP leadership contest, the party's biggest challenge these days is getting noticed, adding that Singh has never walked into a room without becoming the instant centre of attention.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">His launch has been far from flawless, but his skills as a communicator, a conciliator and skilled political organizer will emerge more clearly in the New Year. Some pundits have whispered about his 'ethnicity' challenges, especially in Quebec. Like Obama, Singh does not need to cite his credentials as an authentic advocate of minorities - including Francophone Quebecers, refugees, and the powerless - they are unavoidably in front of your eyes whenever he speaks. New Democrats are slow to love a new leader. It took Jack Layton several years to achieve his incredible plateau of affection and success. Singh is the first since Ed Broadbent to have moved so quickly into the party's affections.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Watt: Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has been a very effective advocate for Canada. Freeland has taken a low-key approach to the <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> negotiations, but has emerged as a key player in the government. As trade negotiations heat up, Freeland will become even more prominent on the domestic front.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Deeply knowledgeable on the issues, Freeland will continue to demonstrate why she is one of this government's most trusted ministers. She's a strong communicator and one to watch moving forward.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Tiffany Gooch is a political strategist at public affairs firms Enterprise and Ensight, secretary of the Ontario Liberal Party Executive Council, and an advocate for increased cultural and gender diversity in Canadian politics.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Robin V. Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, was an NDP strategist for 20 years.</p>\n",

The case stems from the fact that Trinity Western requires students to sign a code of conduct limiting sexual intimacy to heterosexual marriage, a stance many LGBTQ groups find egregious and a reason to deny Trinity Western status as an accredited law school in Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Wagner, who said that LGBTQ groups were adequately represented in the case, declined to allow them as intervenors, leading to a broad outcry on social media. The decision was later reversed by then-Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">A private island set in the cerulean waters of the Caribbean, owned by a reclusive billionaire, approached surreptitiously by luxury helicopter conveying a foreign prime minister and his hand-chosen entourage, all cloaked under a haze of secrecy and bureaucratic bumble-speak.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I think we have here some of the elements of a James Bond movie, absent the salaciously named houris of the Bond franchise. I tell a quieter tale. No giant steel-jawed psychopaths or bowler-hatted assassins in this script. Instead, our dramatis personae comprise a mild-mannered trio: Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, Mary Dawson, the benign Aga Khan, and Canada's champion frequent-flyer Justin <b>Trudeau</b>. This is a trio of personalities as remote from the thoughts of world conquest as the ability to achieve it.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">No one last year begrudged the prime minister's Yuletide Caribbean sojourn.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">However, he and his staff turned it into a mystery. It was their cute effort of trying to shield it from all eyes that - as such attempts always will - turned it into a public issue and elevated it to the Opposition's attention and mortal combat in Question Period. The main item that emerged was, in itself, trivial: the prime minister's travel on the Aga Khan's private helicopter to get to the latter's hideaway private island. It helped that the Aga Khan is a global celebrity and billionaire. That gave the story intrinsic interest. How plutocrats party, and who is on the guest list, is always a welcome tableau in the daily press. Then, too, our own in-house celebrity can claim family friendship with the Aga Khan, and the <span class=\"companylink\">Canadian government</span> has contributed to the latter's humanitarian foundation.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But in the particular instance before us, it was neither the glamour factor nor even the family connections that made the stir. It was that ride on the private helicopter. Should Mr. <b>Trudeau</b> have accepted the transport hospitality? In his position, was he allowed to do so? After some press, and more opposition prodding, the affair was duly set under the Argus-eyed scrutiny of Ms. Dawson, as a matter worthy of her ethical declension. The questions were basic and limited, and, as far as we know, mainly confined to the PM's use of the Aga Khan's helicopter. Was that use proper? Were the rules violated? If so, how serious was the violation? Did it entail penalty? A single trip, one helicopter, a family friend's island - this is not an intricate affair. Yet, it has been since just after Christmas of last year that Ms. Dawson began the investigation, and the investigation still goes on. A year on and no questions answered. Even as Ms. Dawson finished her term and a new commissioner prepares to take up the trail.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What is the point of this commissioner if, on a matter so limited, so absent any features of complexity, or even abstraction, that a full year passes and \"the matter is still under investigation.\" This is not the Warren Commission, or even the great comedy of the inquiry into <b>Trump</b>-Russia collusion.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">We may summarize the mandate: helicopter - it was all right to use; or helicopter - it was not all right to use. A telephone, an internet search or two, and an office assistant to make the call, and it should be done with in an afternoon. Ms. Dawson's other case - the actions of Mr. Bill Morneau - has not quite the same longevity, but is remarkable for another reason. Her public musings on the finance minister's actions are teasingly vague. What she has offered on that more tumultuous file is both vague and ambiguous. Paraphrasing: what he did was legal, says the commissioner, but she advised him not to do it. She neither clears him nor condemns him.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">What is the point of a parliamentary office that is hesitant, tentative, and equivocal in its rulings and semi-rulings? What is the point of a parliamentary office that leaves a charge over a prime minister's ethical reputation unsettled for a whole year? Especially on one bearing no marks of complexity in the material to be investigated? The investigation, in effect, becomes the screen over its own efforts. It presents an inert, passive, incommunicative process - a means of extending doubt, rather than resolving it. While it protractedly continues it provides a shield against learning more, rather than elucidating what is before it. And by doing so, it gives governments an extended stalling space for dealing with the issue.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"I'm co-operating with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner,\" has been the rote non-answer for a year now, whenever someone is under fire in the House. The commissioner's office serves as a kind of half-alibi. Finally, the office itself deflects responsibility from government in a very wide sense. It off-loads the crucial matter of ethics to a third party. It gives ministers, members and the prime minister an off-ramp for explaining choices and practices for which they bear primary responsibility. It puts judgment of the conduct of House of Commons members \"offshore.\" The House itself, its members and ministers and the PM, are the authors and judges of ethics and conflict. The commissioner's office therefore is not only inefficient, it is also an impediment to the very function it was dubiously manufactured to remedy.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The two most enigmatic people in Andrew Scheer's new TV ad[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2017/11/21/opinion-andrew-scheers-dad-jeans-and-awkward-hellos-are-painstakingly-deliberate.html] are the couple at the end of the 30-second spot, who breeze right past the Conservative leader without saying hello.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Now we know where that couple may have been headed — back home, to their laptops, to do a <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> search; something along the lines of “who is Andrew Scheer?”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">According to figures released by Google Trends this week, Scheer was the Canadian politician who prompted the biggest surge in online-search curiosity[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/12/13/top-google-searches-of-2017-andrew-scheer-is-years-most-trending-politician-in-canada_a_23306147/] in this country in 2017. Jagmeet Singh, the new leader of the New Democratic Party, also made the top 10 list of <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> searches in the past year.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It seems that being new or American was the way to get on the Canadian political figures list[https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2017/CA/]. U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b> was at the number one spot, but Canadians were also curious about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Senator John McCain and failed Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore. The new French president, Emmanuel Macron, was at number five on <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span>'s most-searched list.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canadians also showed considerable interest in women on the way up or on the way out of prominence: new Governor General Julie Payette was at the number seven spot, new Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante was at number nine and former B.C. premier Christy Clark was number 10.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Surprisingly, perhaps, Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> did not make the top-10 list at all. Then again, this list is a measure of curiosity and what's unfamiliar to online searchers. After two years in office, <b>Trudeau</b> is a more of a known commodity. People obviously don't feel the need to run to <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> to learn more about him — he's everywhere.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In fact, if that couple in the Scheer ad had run across <b>Trudeau</b>, they likely would have had him pose for a picture with them. Reportedly, the lineup for photos with the prime minister was massive at the annual Liberal Christmas party in Ottawa this week; still snaking around the room as some partygoers were heading home.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Traditionally, popularity like this can be perilous. Canadians have a habit of turning on political figures when they're in their face all the time. Long ago, former prime minister Jean Chrétien even counselled Bill Clinton to adopt a lower profile as U.S. president — telling him that the best way to extend political popularity is to stay out of the headlines. There was a lot of truth in that advice.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> would not likely offer the same counsel, however. He didn't make the top 10 list of <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> searches in 2017, simply because the list was based on short-term spikes in interest. Overall, in the long haul of the past year, <b>Trudeau</b> still enjoys steady, enduring interest in the world of <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> searches.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In fact, if you put the names of <b>Trudeau</b>, Scheer and Singh into the search box at the Google Trends site, <b>Trudeau</b>'s chart lines hover well above[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=CA&amp;q;=andrew%20scheer,justin%20trudeau,jagmeet%20singh] his counterparts in rival parties.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The prime minister's big moment in 2017, according to that chart, came in February, coinciding with his trip to meet <b>Trump</b>. Related search terms with <b>Trudeau</b> in this context included “handshake” and “Ivanka <b>Trump</b>.” Clearly, <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> searches are linked to vivid images — the two most memorable photo opportunities of that <b>Trudeau</b> trip happened when he shook <b>Trump</b>'s hand and when he sat next to the president's daughter at a meeting with Canadian and American businesswomen.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> has a way of turning images into online popularity.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This also isn't new. In fact, if you looked at the same Google Trends charts back in 2013, you got a sneak preview of how the 2015 election would unfold. <b>Trudeau</b>'s own people showed me the trends graph while he was still running for leader in early 2013, to explain why they were so sure he would end up as prime minister. If you had put the names of <b>Trudeau</b>, Stephen Harper and Thomas Mulcair into the search box, it showed massive <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span>-search curiosity for <b>Trudeau</b> — not so much for the other two guys.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So Scheer and Singh might take some heart from the Google Trends list released this week. They may not be household names in Canada yet and they certainly aren't celebrities on the cocktail circuit — that same circuit the Conservative leader ridicules in his home-in-the-suburbs TV ad.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But the new party leaders did at least garner some curiosity this year — and gaining political fame is a long-term project, as Singh told reporters in Ottawa this week. “It's not going to be something that's going to happen overnight and that's OK,” the new NDP leader said.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Who knows? Maybe next year, that couple in the Scheer had will know him well enough to say hello.</p>\n",

       " Donald <b>Trump</b> may be flailing politically. But Thursday brought a reminder that even as the president's stumbles dominate the daily headlines his administration is pulling the United States sharply to the right.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The latest example is the decision by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/12/14/fcc-expected-to-repeal-obama-era-net-neutrality-regulations.html] to give broadband companies much greater power to control what Americans see and hear online.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Republican majority on the <span class=\"companylink\">FCC</span> voted to scrap Obama-era rules that enshrine the principle of “net neutrality” – the idea that the big broadband companies must treat websites equally. They shouldn't be allowed to block some sites, charge more to let consumers access some sites faster than others, or discriminate against some content.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In other words, there should be equal access to the internet and all the information that flows through it.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Ending that principle is a terrible idea. It opens the door to all sorts of abuse by the handful of giant companies that dominate the market for broadband services. One of the two Democrats on the <span class=\"companylink\">FCC</span> warns that Republicans are “handing the keys to the internet” to a “handful of multi-billion dollar corporations.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In principle, those providers could favour their own content over others. Or they could rig the system so that web companies that pay them a fee can deliver content faster to consumers, giving them a crucial edge over competitors who won't pay up.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">They could even choke off free speech for political reasons. That's what already happens in countries like China, where the government makes sure citizens can easily access approved sites while making it painfully slow or even impossible to get information from sites deemed unreliable or hostile.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada, fortunately, is a strong supporter of net neutrality, regarded as a world leader in upholding the principle that the internet should be an open, free-flowing network.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> reiterated that principle as the <span class=\"companylink\">FCC</span> moved toward its decision. “I am very concerned about the attacks on net neutrality,” he said last month. “It's essential to keep the freedom associated with the internet alive.”</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But Canadians should not be complacent that the American decision will leave us untouched, even with a government so firmly committed to maintaining a level playing field on the internet.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For one thing, Canadians rely heavily on all sorts of digital content from U.S.-based sites – from social media to streaming services to news providers. If access to content in the United States is manipulated, it's bound to affect us.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And if U.S. providers really do take advantage of the new rules to favour some content over others (for a fee, naturally), it would be quite predictable for Canadian companies to seek similar treatment in this country in the name of “harmonization.” Pressure on Ottawa to bend the rules could well increase down the road.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">There's no reason to believe things will change overnight. The <span class=\"companylink\">FCC</span>'s move has been sharply contested, and the big U.S. broadband companies like <span class=\"companylink\">Comcast</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">Verizon</span> know they will be under intense scrutiny not to abuse the new powers they are being handed. Consumers and internet advocates will be on guard.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But many billions of dollars are at stake. And over time it may prove irresistible for the providers to take advantage of the rules and bend the internet more and more to their commercial needs. It may start small, but as consumers get used to differentiated services the trend could pick up. Smaller companies and start-ups that can't pay the freight may be squeezed out.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That's why citizens should not have to rely on the goodwill, or even the common sense, of giant companies to guarantee an open, neutral internet. The <span class=\"companylink\">FCC</span>'s decision should be challenged and rolled back.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And even in Canada, where the government stands firm in favour of net neutrality, the principle should not depend on political whim. It should be enshrined in law and made more difficult for future governments to change.</p>\n",

As leading democracies are in retreat or repose – the United States withdrawing from the world, Britain withdrawing from Europe, France and Germany looking inward – Canada is well positioned to seize the day.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead, we praise the man, but ignore his method, heralding Mr. Pearson more than Pearsonianism. We oppose global warming and accept Syrian refugees, yes, but shrink from innovative multilateralism, robust peacekeeping and generous foreign assistance.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Were Mr. Pearson here today, he would loosen his bow tie and sigh. He was about seeking opportunity. An adept stick-handler (they called him “Herr Zig-Zag\" when he played hockey in Switzerland), he had an uncanny sense of where the play was going. He foresaw the shift from the old world to the new, the rise of developing countries, the value of multilateral forums.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">He shaped Canada's role as broker, mediator and at times, moderator of American power.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s understandable top priority is preserving the North American free-trade agreement and managing U.S. President Donald <b>Trump</b>, which he is doing adroitly. To the world, he's the face of a progressive, compassionate country. Branding, looks, socks and selfies help.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Beyond celebrity, it's thin. As activist Robert Greenhill laments, Canada is less back than “far back.\" We talk about a “feminist\" development policy, but it's largely a fig leaf. At 0.26 per cent of GDP, our developmental assistance is collapsing.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">That would particularly disappoint Mr. Pearson, who inspired the creation of a central aid agency and led a <span class=\"companylink\">World Bank</span> commission urging wealthy countries to commit 0.7 per cent to foreign aid.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Liberals promise to return to peacekeeping, Mr. Pearson's creative response to the Suez Crisis in 1956. He made Canada the world's leading peacekeeper (though <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> was always far bigger). After pledging boots in hot spots, today's Liberals offer something less; our consolation is it's better than Mr. Harper's nothing at all.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The Liberals want to regain a seat on the Security Council in 2020 and are mounting a serious campaign. But Mr. <b>Trudeau</b> missed an opportunity in October to make a broad case, instead apologizing to the General Assembly for our treatment of Indigenous Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Curiously, he did not talk about <span class=\"companylink\">UN</span> reform, poverty, nuclear proliferation, Iran and North Korea. In the end, who are we?</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Mr. Pearson knew, which is why we revere him today. A new collection of essays this fall Mike's World, examines his internationalism. His Peace Prize medal is on display, finally, in the Canadian Museum of History. And, last summer, his study was rescued from oblivion and partly remounted in a charming exhibition in Kagawong, Ont., on Manitoulin Island, Mr. Pearson's old riding.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In 2017, Mr. Pearson lives. He calls Canada to the world, again, with eloquence, authority and urgency.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the end, China wasn't moved. Not by Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s charisma.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Nor his press clippings. And certainly not by the prospect of a \"progressive\" trade deal with Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Instead of launching free trade talks this week, as was expected, <b>Trudeau</b> left China with a meek commitment to \"exploratory talks to continue on a framework for a Canada-China free trade agreement,\" a result that fills a tweet and not much else.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\"><b>Trudeau</b> has spent much of the past two years making kissy faces at China. He even made John McCallum, one of his veteran cabinet ministers, his man in Beijing. All for naught.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">\"Canada is committed to moving forward on progressive trade deals that involve things like chapters on gender, on the environment, on labour,\" <b>Trudeau</b> explained to reporters. \"China is very aware that this is a precedent as they move forward with their first trade deal with a <span class=\"companylink\">G7</span> country, and there's a desire to make sure we get it right.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Got that, China? You'll need to play by Canada's rules if you want a little <span class=\"companylink\">G7</span> action. And China's response? Stony silence.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">China just isn't in the market for \"progressive\" trade deals. They already enjoy enormous trade surpluses with <span class=\"companylink\">G7</span> countries. \"Free\" trade with China isn't about being \"progressive,\" it's about doing what China wants.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But what would it take for Canada to get the deal it needs? Sadly, nothing Canada has to sell. We don't have that kind of leverage, even if we offered the oilsands to China on a silver platter. I think <b>Trudeau</b> recognizes this as fact, but wanted to give it a try for domestic purposes.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">It's not the trade failure with China that rankles; that's a good thing, on balance. But when placed next to our argy-bargy in Vietnam over the terms of the Trans Pacific Partnership, and the ongoing <span class=\"companylink\">NAFTA</span> rodeo with an increasingly erratic Donald <b>Trump</b>, our free-trading perch feels precarious. And failure on all three fronts would hoof us squarely in the GDP. The government needs a result.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Despite the grand proclamations that Canada is \"back,\" <b>Trudeau</b>'s celebrity and well-intentioned words haven't moved the dial on global trade. Or the fight against ISIS. Or Russia. Or the environment, really.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">No Canadian leader has ever truly commanded the world stage. We're not equipped for the task, even when our leader rockets out of central casting to tick the boxes of desperate liberals around the world.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Canada's influence in the world is a function of that of our neighbour to the south. If the United States isn't pulling in the same direction, all our fancy talk about free trade, freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law are wasted breath.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">And right now the U.S. is led by a narcissist who hates trade, digs authoritarians, hammers the free press and retweets hate groups, and whose lawyers are arguing he is above the law.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This doesn't mean things such as a feminist foreign policy or a progressive trade agenda aren't worth doing. But we must acknowledge the hard limits of our soft power.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">So when <b>Trudeau</b> goes to China to talk about progressive trade, the real audience is at home. He might not be able to change things in the current climate, but he wants voters to know his heart is in the right place, because his re-election will come before any helpful change in U.S. leadership.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">But <b>Trudeau</b> shouldn't limit himself to foreign rhetoric. Why not tackle our inter-provincial barriers to trade? Why not invest more in the military? Why not get our books in order? These things are within Justin <b>Trudeau</b>'s power to fix, and would do more to strengthen our hand abroad than play-acting with people who have no interest in Canada's values.

       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Last week at the Toronto Reference Library, hundreds of Black Canadian leaders, policy wonks, media personalities, academics, activists, business professionals and artists aligned for celebrations and strategic planning sessions at the inaugural National Black Canadians Summit in recognition of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Trailblazers and change-makers gathered from across the country to discuss democratic engagement, affordable housing and shelter, Black ownership and wealth, community safety, access to justice, education, mental health, migration and inclusion, media representation, arts and Black identity.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The event was hosted as a partnership between the Michaëlle Jean Foundation and newly founded Federation of Black Canadians. It felt more like a family reunion than a conference.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Jean, Canada's former governor general, was a gracious host. She brought the Canadian Black community together in a way only a diplomat could. Floating through the library, she shared special moments with each participant, engaged in the strategic planning sessions and delivered a fiery keynote speech.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">She shared stories about her month-long decision-making process to accept the appointment as the 27th governor general of Canada. She wanted to ensure each role she took on was one from which she could initiate meaningful change. She later spoke of the culturally rich and proud revolutionary history of Haiti: \"More than resilience, I call it resistance.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This was an important moment for Black political organization in Canada.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">South of the border, Donald <b>Trump</b> continues to launch attacks on Black athletes, media personalities and civic leaders. He's openly supporting Roy Moore in his Senate race, who stated in September that America was last great \"at the time when families were united - even though we had slavery ... Our families were strong, our country had a direction.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">This week, Democratic representatives John Lewis and Bennie G. Thompson organized a boycott around <b>Trump</b>'s attendance at the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. The White House press secretary seemed to forget that Rep. Lewis himself is a storied civil rights hero, having led and participated in peaceful protests alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. since his time as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. She had the audacity to lecture on respect for the legacy of the movement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">While the Toronto conference was organized as a Canadian community-led recognition of the UN Decade for People of African Descent, community members continue to wait, with waning patience, for Prime Minister Justin <b>Trudeau</b> to show leadership on the issues discussed.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Municipal, provincial and federal political representatives braved the tough crowd, which was unapologetic in expecting an authenticity supported with timely action few politicians are able to master.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">In the end, there was clear agreement that we should do this more often. Events like this allow us to share best practices across sectors, nurture relationships and amplify great ideas, which significantly strengthen our work.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">The definition of success for Black political organization and activism in Canada differed between the organizers in attendance. The Black community in Canada is not homogeneous.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">My experience as a fifth-generation Black Canadian from Windsor, whose family liberated themselves from slavery on a journey to a life of freedom in Canada through the Underground Railroad, is different and yet in so many ways parallel to that of many of the organizers I met this week. We are spread across the country organizing in communities with varying priorities, tactics and levels of political engagement.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">For all of our differences, we agreed that better co-ordination and amplification of great ideas is necessary. And so we will continue to organize in community centres, businesses, church basements, living rooms and libraries - ready to thunderclap and speak with one voice when we are aligned on the issues and when it's needed most.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">I was honoured to join one of the panel discussions and was nearly reduced to tears as community elder June Girvan from Black History Ottawa rose to tell us, \"You are the generation we've been waiting for.\"</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">During her visit to Toronto last month, Michelle Obama made an important point. We don't need one or two great leaders to move our work forward, we need thousands. This conference was an important step forward in empowering effective intergenerational leadership.</p>\n",
       " <p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\">Like all great Black family reunions, the event ended with the electric slide - a beautiful moment of joy and celebration as we prepare for the difficult work that lies ahead.</p>\n",
