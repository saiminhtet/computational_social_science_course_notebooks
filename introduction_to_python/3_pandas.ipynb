Biological activities have been most clearly defined in leukocytes, where chemokines coordinate development, differentiation, anatomic distribution, trafficking, and effector functions and thereby regulate innate and adaptive immune responses. Pharmacological analysis of chemokine receptors is at an early stage of development. Disease indications have been established in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and in Plasmodium vivax malaria, due to exploitation of CCR5 and Duffy, respectively, by the pathogen for cell entry.

      "Citations 803\n",
      "Absract: Currently used pharmaceutical nanocarriers, such as liposomes, micelles, nanoemulsions, polymeric nanoparticles and many others demonstrate a broad variety of useful properties, such as longevity in the blood allowing for their accumulation in pathological areas with compromised vasculature; specific targeting to certain disease sites due to various targeting ligands attached to the surface of the nanocarriers; enhanced intracellular penetration with the help of surface-attahced cell-penetrating molecules; contrast properties due to the carrier loading with various contrast materials allowing for direct carrier visualization in vivo; stimuli-sensitivity allowing for drug release from the carriers under certain physiological conditions, and others. Some of those pharmaceutical carriers have already made their way into clinic, while others are still under preclinical development. What could be seen much more rare, however, are the pharmaceutical nanocarriers combining several from the listed abilities. Long-circulating immunoliposomes capable of prolonged residence in the blood and specific target recognition represent one of few examples of this kind. At the same time, the enginnering of multifunctional pharmaceutical nanocarriers combinig several useful preoperties in one particle can significantly enhance the efficacy of many therapeutic and diagnostic protocols. This paper considers current status and possible future directions in the emerging area of multifunctional nanocarriers with primary attention on the combination of such properties as longevity, targetability, intracellular penetration and contrast loading.

      "Citations 669\n",
      "Absract: The field of biomedical dendrimers is still in its infancy, but the explosion of interest in dendrimers and dendronised polymers as inherently active therapeutic agents, as vectors for targeted delivery of drugs, peptides and oligonucleotides, and as permcability enhancers able to promote oral and transdermal drug delivery makes it timely to review Current knowledge regarding the toxicology of these dendrimer chemistries (currently under development for biomedical applications). Clinical experience with polymeric excipients, plasma expanders, and most recently the development of more 'classical polymer'-derived therapeutics can be used to guide development of \"safe\" dendritic polymers. Moreover, in future it will only ever be possible to designate a dendruner as \"safe\" when related to a specific application. The so far limited clinical experience using dendrimers make it impossible to designate any particular chemistry intrinsically \"safe\" or \"toxic\". Although there is widespread concern as to the safety of nano-sized particles, preclinical and clinical experience gained during the development of polymeric excipients, biomedical polymers and polymer therapeutics shows that judicious development of dendrimer chemistry for each specific application will ensure development of safe and important materials for biomedical and pharmaceutical use.

      "Citations 665\n",
      "Absract: Ten years ago, we wrote a Review on lipid rafts and signalling in the launch issue of Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology. At the time, this field was suffering from ambiguous methodology and imprecise nomenclature. Now, new techniques are deepening our insight into the dynamics of membrane organization. Here, we discuss how the field has matured and present an evolving model in which membranes are occupied by fluctuating nanoscale assemblies of sphingolipids, cholesterol and proteins that can be stabilized into platforms that are important in signalling, viral infection and membrane trafficking.\n",

      "Title: A small-molecule, nonpeptide CCR5 antagonist with highly potent and selective anti-HIV-1 activity\n",
      "Citations 638\n",
      "Absract: The beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 is considered to be an attractive target for inhibition of macrophage-tropic (CCR5-using or R5) HIV-1 replication because individuals having a nonfunctional receptor (a homozygous 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 coding region) are apparently normal but resistant to infection with R5 HIV-1. In this study, we found that TAK-779, a nonpeptide compound with a small molecular weight (M-r 531.13), antagonized the binding of RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) to CCR5-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells and blocked CCR5-mediated Ca2+ signaling at nanomolar concentrations. The inhibition of beta-chemokine receptors by TAK-779 appeared to be specific to CCR5 because the compound antagonized CCR2b to a lesser extent but did not affect CCR1, CCR3, or CCR4. Consequently, TAK-779 displayed highly potent and selective inhibition of R5 HIV-I replication without showing any cytotoxicity to the host cells. The compound inhibited the replication of R5 HIV-1 clinical isolates as well as a laboratory strain at a concentration of 1.6-3.7 nM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, though it was totally inactive against T-cell line-tropic (CXCR4-using or X4) HIV-1.\n",

      "Citations 607\n",
      "Absract: Leptomycin B (LMB) is a Streptomyces metabolite that, inhibits nuclear export of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 regulatory protein Rev at low nanomolar concentrations. Recently, LMB was shown to inhibit the function of CRM1, a receptor for the nuclear export signal (NES). Here we show evidence that LIMB binds directly to CRMI1 and that CRM1 is essential for NES-dependent nuclear export of proteins in both yeast and mammalian cells. Binding experiments with a biotinylated derivative of LMB and a HeLa cell extract led to identifying CRM1 as a major protein that bound to the LMB derivative. Microinjection of a purified anti-human CRM1 antibody into the mammalian nucleus specifically inhibited nuclear export of NES-containing proteins, as did LMB. Consistent with this, CRM1 was found to interact with NES, when assayed with immobilized NES and HeLa cell extracts. This association was disrupted by adding LMB or purified anti-human CRM1 antibody. The inhibition of CRM1 by LIMB was also observed in fission yeast. The fission yeast crm1 mutant was defective in the nuclear export of NES-fused proteins, but not in the import of nuclear localization signal (NLS)-fused proteins. Interestingly, a protein containing both NES and NLS, which is expected to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm, was highly accumulated in the nucleus of the crm1 mutant cells or of cells treated with LMB. These results strongly suggest that CRM1 is the target of LIMB and is an essential factor for nuclear export of proteins in eukaryotes. (C) 1998 Academic Press.\n",

      "Title: Potent inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity in macrophages and lymphocytes by a novel CCR5 antagonist\n",
      "Citations 536\n",
      "Absract: The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 have recently been shown to act as coreceptors, in concert with CD4, for human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection. RANTES and other chemokines that interact with CCR5 and block infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures inhibit infection of primary macrophages inefficiently at best. If used to treat HIV-1-infected individuals, these chemokines could fail to influence HIV replication in nonlymphocyte compartments while promoting unwanted inflammatory side effects. A derivative of RANTES that was created by chemical modification of the amino terminus, aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES, did not induce chemotaxis and was a subnanomolar antagonist of CCR5 function in monocytes. It potently inhibited infection of diverse cell types (including macrophages and lymphocytes) by nonsyncytium-inducing, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains. Thus, activation of cells by chemokines is not a prerequisite for the inhibition of viral uptake and replication. Chemokine receptor antagonists like AOP-RANTES that achieve full receptor occupancy at nanomolar concentrations are strong candidates for the therapy of HIV-1-infected individuals.\n",

      "Citations 503\n",
      "Absract: Nucleic-acid aptamers have attracted intense interest and found wide applications in a range of areas. in this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of aptamer-based biosensors and bioassay methods, most of which have employed electrochemical, optical and mass-sensitive analytical techniques. Aptamers exhibit many advantages as recognition elements in biosensing when compared to traditional antibodies. They are small in size, chemically stable and cost effective. More importantly, aptamers offer remarkable flexibility and convenience in the design of their structures, which has led to novel biosensors that have exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity. Recently, the combination of aptamers with novel nanomaterials has significantly improved the performance of aptamer-based sensors, which we also review in this article. In view of the unprecedented advantages brought by aptamers, we expect aptamer-based biosensors to find broad applications in biomedical diagnostics, environmental monitoring and homeland security.
