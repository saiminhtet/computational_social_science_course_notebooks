    "## Some key takeaways from the readings\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computers are best at the kind of things humans find boring and mind-numbing. When you learn how to speak to the computer, you can delegate those boring tasks and focus on the things that you are unique suited for (as a human...) \n",
    "* Your Python scripts (and scripts in other languages) are just sets of instructions for your computer to follow. Your computer will not understand your instructions if there are errors -- however small -- in your instructions. Remember, your computer is *not* smart. It is not intelligent at all. You must be *very precise* when you communicate with it.\n",
    "* According to Severance, you need two skills to be a programmer. As he puts it: \n",
    "    1. 'First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You need to be able to spell the words in this new language properly and know how to construct well-formed “sentences” in this new language.'\n",
    "    2. 'Second, you need to “tell a story”. In writing a story, you combine words and sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in constructing the story, and skill in story writing is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In programming, our program is the “story” and the problem you are trying to solve is the “idea”.'\n",
    "\n",
    "> You will learn the “vocabulary” and “sentences” of Python pretty quickly. It will take longer for you to be able to write a coherent program to solve a brand-new problem. We teach programming much like we teach writing. We start reading and explaining programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write in- creasingly complex programs over time. At some point you “get your muse” and see the patterns on your own and can see more naturally how to take a problem and write a program that solves that problem. And once you get to that point, programming becomes a very pleasant and creative process. (Severance)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some words in Python are \"reserved.\" What are they? (Hint: remember the dog analogy)\n",
    "* \"Low-level conceptual patterns\" used to construct programs:\n",
    "    * **input**: Get data from the “outside world”. This might be reading data from a file, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.\n",
    "    * **output**: Display the results of the program on a screen or store them in a file or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.\n",
    "    * **Sequential execution**: Perform statements one after another in the order they are encountered in the script.\n",
    "    * **Sequential execution**:  Perform statements one after another in the order they are encountered in the script.\n",
    "    * **Conditional execution**: Check for certain conditions and then execute or skip a sequence of statements.\n",
    "    * **Repeated execution**: Perform some set of statements repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n",
    "    * **Reuse**: Write a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those instructions as needed throughout your program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> It sounds almost too simple to be true, and of course it is never so simple. It is like saying that walking is simply “putting one foot in front of the other”. The “art” of writing a program is composing and weaving these basic elements together many times over to produce something that is useful to its users. (Severance)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It takes a while to learn and understand a new language. It might take a bit of time before this feels natural. \n",
    "\n",
    "Severance constrasts 3 different types of errors you are likely to encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax errors** 'These are the first errors you will make and the easiest to fix. A syntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of Python. Python does its best to point right at the line and character where it noticed it was confused. The only tricky bit of syntax errors is that sometimes the mistake that needs fixing is actually earlier in the program than where Python noticed it was confused. So the line and character that Python indicates in a syntax error may just be a starting point for your investigation.'\n",
    "2. **Logic errors** 'A logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another. A good example of a logic error might be, “take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the bottle.”'\n",
    "3. **Semantic errors** 'A semantic error is when your description of the steps to take is syntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake in the program. The program is perfectly correct but it does not do what you intended for it to do. A simple example would be if you were giving a person directions to a restaurant and said, “. . . when you reach the intersection with the gas station, turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red building on your left.” Your friend is very late and calls you to tell you that they are on a farm and walking around behind a barn, with no sign of a restaurant. Then you say “did you turn left or right at the gas station?” and they say, “I followed your directions perfectly, I have them written down, it says turn left and go one mile at the gas station.” Then you say, “I am very sorry, because while my instructions were syntactically correct, they sadly contained a small but undetected semantic error.”.'"

    "Some terrific advice from Severance:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in staying up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a snack, explain what you are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. I assure you that once you learn the programming concepts in the book you will look back and see that it was all really easy and elegant and it simply took you a bit of time to absorb it."
